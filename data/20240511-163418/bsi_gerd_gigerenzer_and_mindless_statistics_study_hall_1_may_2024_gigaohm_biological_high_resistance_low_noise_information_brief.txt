(soft music), (soft music), (soft music)(soft music)(soft music)- I can't believe it, Kara. You're not even second place.You're not even third place.Kara, where are you?I mean, I was trying to get Kara to win the cash moneythis morning and then Kara's not even fifth.Oh my gosh, she's not even gonna make sixth place.Oh my goodness.What is happening?Good morning, Christie.Good morning, Solar Fire.Daniel, Annie.Where in the heck is Kara?She didn't make it.It's like she didn't,I really, she like texted me and said she was gonna be firstin the chat and it was gonna be all cooland she was gonna win the money, the big cash prizeand Kara's not there.Like, wow, she didn't make it.Very funny.Very, very odd.But that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.This is where we are, ladies and gentlemen.Good morning, Jeff from Earth.You guys really were late.Like, what's up with that?I totally had it set up.Wow.Good to see you guys.Thank you very much for joining me.(dramatic music), (dramatic music), (dramatic music), (dramatic music)(dramatic music)(dramatic music). (dramatic music). (dramatic music), (dramatic music)(dramatic music)Mark put it all on the line yesterday.If you missed his, trying it for a third time,check that stream out.Say it like it is.If you're not talking about murder and lying about it,then you're not, I know the date's wrong in the title.I can't fix it now live, but I will fix it again.I guess I left out the zero.I might have run out of room.Maybe I didn't have enough.Might not have had enough text.Might not have let me fill that in.So I'll fix it in the post.Sorry about that.One man show.I think truth is good for kids.We're so busy lying, we don't even recognizethe truth no more in the society.We want everybody to feel good.That's not the way life is.I think, but you can tell if someone's lying,you know, you can sort of feel it in people.And I have lied, I'm sure I'll lie again.I don't want to lie, you know,I don't think I'm a liar.I try not to be a liar.I don't want to be a liar.I think it's like really important not to be a liar.(dramatic music)(dramatic music)- I'm not sure exactly who he is.His name is JJ Cooley,and I believe he's a consultant for CHD.And I believe he has a PhD in some sort ofscientific discipline from what I understand.(birds chirping)I like that, and I don't like that.I like the idea that storytelling is a form of lying.It certainly can be.Good storytelling can be incredibly effective way.Excuse me, of lying, I'm gonna drink a lot of coffee just now.But it worries me a little bitthat that statement also kind ofdiscounts the power of storytellingand why storytelling can be usedto pass on very important knowledgewithout necessarily on the face being that important knowledge.I just, I do think we have to be very carefulbecause what we do here on Giga Home Biologicalis try to tell the story succinctly of the sacred biologyand hope that that story makes more sensethan the stories, the lies that they have been told.And so it is, storytelling is how humans communicate actuallyand storytelling is an art form that,that, you know, goes back many, many, many generations.Communicating with other humans through storiesis essentially the enchantment.It's how enchantments are cast.And being able to tell that storyhas to do with being able to distort the truthinto simple, simple,simple models and simple explanationsand that people accept because they are ableto make rudimentary predictions with thoseor have been led to believe that those modelscan make predictions that they can't,which I think is closer to the truth.And so if you have bros with showsthat are telling stories,then it doesn't really matter what's true.It matters what's perceived to be true,especially if people are gonna listen intentlyto those bros with shows.And essentially that's what's going on right now.You got bros with shows that have taught our children,our young people to attribute bad motivesto those that disagree with themrather than arguing with logic or facts.And of course this maneuver has taken many years.It's happened in our schools and universitiesas well as on the interwebs with these peoplethat they put in front of usthat don't seem to be able to talk aboutthe real value of money or fiat currenciesor what fractional reserve meansand whether or not fractional reserve banking is good or badand who controls it, does that matter.None of this stuff is discussedby any of these bros with showsbecause they are involved in making surethat we don't ask the right questions,that we don't ask the right questionsthat will allow our children to seebecause they know there are three classes of peopleand they want our children to be firmlyin the third group of people that do not see.And they can do that.They can do that by teaching our kids not to see.And they want our kids to believe that AI is the real Godthat they need to be afraid of,the real power that they need to worship,the real ruling class.They're all submitting to it.And it's because they've all been told over several decades,they've all been told over several decadesthat if we just collect the data,that we can solve giant problems,that we could become demigods,that we could control the evolution of humans.And these are people who are descendantfrom a history of bad ideas.Back when the special cancer virus programwas thinking that they could accelerate human evolutionby exposing animals and humans and cells to radiation.And so, so much of the work on nuclear energyand nuclear bombs and cancer and evolution and DNAwas all tied together back when these peoplewere really, really bonafide, dark-aged dipshits.And those people taught their studentsand taught their students, and believe it or not,a lot of those students are now in front of usright now pretending that their model of the worldwith retroviruses and coronaviruses is the model.And if we don't learn the historyof where these dumb ideas came fromand who put them there and who perpetuated themand identify them for the charlatansthat they are before the history is erased,our children will be enslaved by these charlatans.Not just these charlatans, but also the charlatansthat are currently wearing the COVID shots is bad,but don't talk about 2020 T-shirts.Because they are not interestedin making gentle the life of this world.They're not interested in the freedom of your grandchildren.They're actually working for the slavers.They're actually trying to work for the slavers.The owners of the weaponized piles of moneythat actually run the show,that control social media, that control the television,those weaponized piles of moneythat are creating the wave that we needto make our children aware of,make our teachers aware of, make our neighbors aware of,and this wave of chaos and destructionis produced by these weaponized piles of money.This wave that's currently crashing our civilization,this wave was created by these weaponized piles of money.And if we're gonna teach our kids to surf on it,they've gotta be aware of it,and they've gotta know who the people are,and they've gotta know the lies they told.And that's our job, and it's gonna take us doing it,us adults that have already been trying to surf this wavefor four plus years,and adults that have been trying to surf this wavefor longer, you realize that there are peoplethat have been fighting against the biologyof the vaccine schedule since before the pandemic,and none of those people are in front of us right now.None of those people are helping us stay focusedon the biology, none of those people are helping usnot take the bait on TV,and none of those people are helping us love our neighborbecause the algorithms won't let us see them.They won't even let us know they're therebecause the primary anti-vaxxerthat we're supposed to pay attention tois Robert Wallace Malone,one of the biggest fakes on the internet.Ladies and gentlemen, the way this worksis if you can share it,so please continue to share it everywherethat social media works.We need to pollute that cesspool of informationwith our own cleanliness,and hope that some of the soap smell spreads aroundand that people wake up.That's what we need to do.That's how we need to win.Ladies and gentlemen,this, I guess, is a giga-owned biological,a high-resistance low-noise information briefbrought to you by a biologist,and we are coming to you live from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,in the back of a garage of a rented house,and we are funded, unlike PBS NewsHour,only by fellow peasants like you,fellow people who are not in the big club,fellow people who a lot of you probably didn't knowthat the vaccine schedule was criminal before the pandemic.You were just like me.You thought that they were lying,but I mean, they weren't really lying, were they?And it really is gonna require all of usto take our hands down,all of us to drop our, see, 15-year anti-vaxxers, man.That's what I'm talking about.You guys make me look like a chump,because I've had my hands above my,in front of my eyes since really 2022is the last year that I didn't know it.Ladies and gentlemen, United Non-Compliance,this is giga-owned biological.I'm a human just like you.Welcome to the show.(upbeat music)(upbeat music)Well, in case it wasn't obvious,this is a one-man show.I still can't produce the show liveas well as I would like to.I'm still making a lot of mistakeswith what buttons to push and where to goand what timings.But this is giga-owned biological.Welcome to the show.It's the 10th of May, 2024.I've got a little different thing that I wanna do today.So just a quick introduction.Ladies and gentlemen, intramuscular injectionof any combination of substanceswith the intent of augmenting the immune system is dumb.Transfection in healthy humans is criminally negligent.And RNA cannot pandemic.We will spend a day or two every weektalking about some aspect of these main statements,these main messages of giga-owned biological.But today we're gonna take a little step backand look a little bit at where broken scienceand Greg Glassman and Emily Kaplan have opened my mindto another aspect of the illusionfrom a different perspective, a different angle,it's a different part of the elephant.And I do think it's something that over time,giga-owned biological is gonna incorporatemore and more of this pursuit of understandingof this level of the illusion to the show.And so today I wanna do one of the first,- But I want is high morbidity.- One of the first broken science initiative ones.So I'm just gonna give you a brief introductionof where we are.Remember, the idea is that people on the internetwere seeding this narrative from the very beginning.We assumed that the narrative was really just on television,but actually the narrative much more malevolentlythan any of us, including myself, ever estimated,would also be seeded on the internetby people large and small, by people promotedand not promoted.And in fact, it's even possiblethat a exorbitant amount of people were seededand the ones that spontaneously were ableto attract attention were the onesthat then the operation sort of promoted.And some of these people may have missed the audition spaceor missed the audition cutoff and didn't get promotedor didn't get their sub-stack up or whatever.And so in 2024, we're really left with a selectionof the best narrative controllers.We're left with the best, most committed,most trustworthy participantsin the national security narrative.And I think it's very possiblethat that national security narrativeis very adequately summarized by this slide.I do think it's possible that if you think about it,there really are only two groups.There's a group of people that saysthat the COVID shots are badand they've been saying it for kind of a while.And those same people have been focusedfrom the very beginning on making surethat you don't think about how long it tookbefore you saw them.Specifically, I'm talking right nowabout Brett Weinstein, Robert Malone, and Steve Kurishwho came out in June of 2021,exactly one year and six months too lateto make any difference for the resistance,for the dissident ideas that might have been in placebefore the university students were forcedto go back to university under full COVID illusions in 2020.Back when Richard Ebright said it would be criminalto open up the universitiesbecause it might kill 250,000 university studentsbefore Christmas.Richard Ebright should really be on this screen hereas part of one of these worst case scenario people,but Richard Ebright never made a phone call to me,was never in a signal chat with me,he's never sent me an email or anything like that.Whereas with all of these other people,I've smelled their breath, shaken their hand,taken a selfie with them and have them blow sunshineup my ass about how cool it is, the work that you do.But absolutely none of these people on social mediahave ever promoted the cool work that I do.None of these people have really made an effortto try and raise my boat,but instead have made a very concerted effortto find out what I think and take whatever useful tidbitsthat they are still able to useand not qualify to wear that t-shirt.And so for a little while, some of these poserswere starting to talk about clonesbecause they thought that they could convince methat clones could spread around just like a regular RNA virus,they say can spread around.And the moment that I pushed back against thatand the moment I said no, what I'm arguing is,is that the regular RNAs don't spread aroundbecause there's no evidence for that in the literature.And therefore the way that they have overcome that problemis that they resort to making synthetic clones.And the synthetic clones are only usefulbecause then many laboratories can startfrom the same pure placeand then they can use the same cell culture.And basically it's the same experimental starting pointwhich can make sense from a biological perspectiveunless the starting point of synthetic infectious clonesis already a dumb place to startbecause it doesn't recapitulate whatever signal is in nature,but instead creates a purity of an RNA or a DNA moleculethat would never exist.And so whatever you get when you put that on a cell cultureis also something that would never existand doesn't recapitulate whatever it wasfrom which you say you're deriving the original DNAor RNA signal from.And this illusion stays very consistentfrom AIDS to the chronic fatigue syndrome dramasthat Judy Mikovits was involved in,all the way up until nowwhen we talked about flu for 15 yearsand then all the way up until nowwhen we've talked about coronavirusesand flu is one of these things that fits right inbut it's kind of doesn'tbecause flu viruses are really interesting.They need their own enzymes,they're not readable RNAs, the RNAs are fragmented,they can grow them in eggsbut they can't really grow them in eggsbecause sometimes they don't growwhat they're supposed to growor the strains are different.And so it's actually interesting.The flu is an actually an interesting phenomenonwhich may have more basis in realitythan any of these other thingsthat we're supposed to be more focused on.And I think that's also part of the illusionthat these people are wittingly or unwittingly protecting.I do think it's very likely,although at this stage I like to take Mike Eden's positionand I'm just not sophisticated enough to knowbecause they've been lying for so longbut I suspect that some of these signalsmaybe herpes virus,maybe some of these cytomegaloviruses that are really big.Maybe some of these viruses are real phenomenonthat we don't understand that have been mischaracterizedas representing edifying parallel phenomenonwhich support the idea of AIDSand support the idea of coronavirus.And so we can identify and study some of these virusesand then some of these biologists are actually doing real workand then assume that the coronavirus biologistsand the AIDS viruses people are doing good work too.So the illusion seated over many, many yearsin the scientific literature and in the universitiesis now was now and I believe before the pandemicactually becoming questionedbecause of people like Brian Hooker and Laura Bonoand all of these autism momsthat were starting to organize behind ICANN and CHDand children's health defense and ICANNtherefore needed to be controlledeither upon their formation, they were already controlledbecause they knew this was a problemthat the vaccine schedule,people were starting to become skepticalthat it was starting to spread around.They made a movie that Robert De Niro went onthe morning news and said everybody should seeand that was the movie "Vaxed".And so the crazy part is ladies and gentlemenand let's think about this for a second.The movie "Vaxed" came out a few years before the pandemicand then Robert De Niro was on the news saying that,maybe autism is caused by the vaccine scheduleand then crazy enough and those same yearsthat's when the intellectual dark web was establishedthat Jordan Peterson and Brett Weinsteinsuddenly were very popular and public on the social mediaabout how they were standing up against their universityor some kind of free speech or that kind of thingthat Sam Harris decided to do a podcastthat Joe Rogan got the big deal,that Tom Cowan had a book that Judy Mikovits has a bookthat Andy Slavitt has a bookthat the real Anthony Fauci book came outthat Alina Chan had a bookthat all these books coming out in 2016, 17, 18, 19when everybody is really starting to wake upabout the idea that the vaccine schedule in Americamight be screwed, the movie "Vaxed" too is being produced.And so I think what you need to seeit's a combination of the obviously the financial systemin America eventually going to collapseand the simultaneous illusionof the public health system in America was about to collapsebecause you have all this profit,you have all these advertisements on TV,you have these autism moms that are getting attentionon the today show because of Robert De Niroand then what do you do?Well, you make sure that ICANN is never gonna make progress.You make sure that CHD is never gonna make progressbecause Brian Hooker could change the worldif they put him in front of the CHD all the timeand they said that absolutely specificallywe wanna stop the vaccine schedulebecause we have evidence to believethat it's criminal in America.That would have been a message that would have caused CHDto either succeed or need to be destroyed.And so I'm gonna say something very hardcore herebut I'm gonna say it, I think CHDand maybe also ICANN are organizationsthat because of saboteurs inside of bothof those organizations that some people may or may notbe aware of, they have effectively not gotten a touchdowneven though they probably were close to scoring a touchdownwith Vaxt and with Vaxt too.They didn't score a touchdown.And I think that's by design.And I think for a while they were trying to incorporate meinto it with comfort and money.And I didn't go along with it.I was offered an NDA and $8,000 if I would keep my mouth shutafter they laid me off and I did not take that moneyeven though my family desperately needed it.And now we're basically paying part of our bills every monthwith a credit card.And you might say, wow, you're pretty stupidbut you know what?We don't have, this is it.I know it, I know it in my bones.My kids will either be free because I fought and stood upand did not back down or my kids will be enslavedbecause I stopped, because I wimped out,because I felt overwhelmed or because I just thoughtI couldn't win.And I'm not, I don't believe that.I believe that actually we are right nowat a crucial stage where all of those peoplewearing that COVID shots are bad,don't talk about 2020, they're all doubling down.And they have no alternative but to ignore mebecause it's gonna get much, much worse.One of the things that I would suggest you do as homeworkbefore I show you how bad it is,is to look at some of the videos that Mark Kulakis loading up on Hustonik Live 3.And they are specifically there is onethat's absolutely extraordinary and maybe morewhere none other than Paul Kattrell,the absolutely fake doctor who was absolutely streamingwith Addy Ads, myself and Kevin McCarronfor nearly two months at the beginning of the pandemic,pretending to be an MD all the while having a PhDin chaos theory and finance,claiming to have going through some pre-med programat Harvard and he's a liar.He was promoted by George Webb who's also a liar.And he did several streams with Robert Wallace Malone.Malone who on his stream characterized DOD as us,who on his stream talked about insider connectionsin DARPA and, or sorry, in DITRA and in other places,bragged about his connections with Cadlich,bragged about his connections with three letter agencieswith Paul Kattrell, taking Paul Kattrell's questionsseriously, actually lending credibility to a fake doctorwho in my mind, it's extraordinary to thinkthat somebody like Robert Wallace Malone would beon in August of 2021 after being on Brett Weinstein's podcastslumming with Paul Kattrell.An obvious fraud.I mean, it's pathetic.Even Kevin McCarron, his shtick was built around the ideathat Paul Kattrell was a fraud.Part of his shtick for the whole of 2020 wasthat Paul Kattrell is selling silver supplementsor some shit.And as I've said yesterday, and we'll say again,part of the shtick that these people have playedon each other and other people that have tried toget their message out through them is that they makethese little arguments between each other and pretendthat, you know, like, I don't know, Steve doesn't agreewith Brett.And so there's some, you know, debate that you shouldtake a side on.And then if you take a side of Steve Kersh,then Steve Kersh will make you feel like he agreeswith you and you are together in opposing the idea of Brett.And then so it really feels like they're paying attentionto you when in reality they're just screwing around.And they did this on Telegram, Gab, Signal,anywhere that they existed.That's the joke that these people are.And I think some of the biggest players are peoplelike Kevin McKernan, who have been involved inwrangling these cats since the very beginning.And the best example I have, how early,is the Corbyn Jorston report.Kevin McKernan is on a paper, not objecting to PCR testingfor coronavirus, but objecting to the primer setthat they chose.And I'm just gonna throw this speculation out there.I'm willing to bet that Michael Yeadon doesn't know enoughabout PCR primers to have written a paperabout objecting about the PCR primers.I'm willing to bet that the other people on that paper,a lot of them are not sophisticated enough.Claire Craig, you think so?What about Thomas Binder?Do you think he knows a lot about PCR primers?I'm not saying Thomas Binder's a bad guy.I'm saying that he got roped in to that paperby Kevin McKernan and by the other guythat organized it, that other name.I can't remember it anymore,but it's the first author of that paper, I believe.Peter Borger is another person that I'm not sureis a bad guy or a good guy,but was definitely involved in that paperin setting this group of people up to be dissidentsand be on the same team and agree about stuff.And then what that also did, of course,was it put Kevin McKernan very early in contactwith the people that probably needed the most control,the ones that have turned out to be the most problem.How is it that Kevin McKernan, Mr. Human Genome Project,Mr. Applied Biosystems, Mr. Marblehead Mansion Guy,with $10,000 cats, is having a paper about PCR primersnot objecting to using PCR,but objecting to the who getting a paper published so quickwith the wrong primers.Why would he be on that paper?Why would he be on that paper unless the idea wasto introduce an expert to themso that they themselves would never thinkthat they needed to dig themselves outof a coronavirus mystery that involved lyingabout a PCR test because we have this great expert,Kevin McKernan on the paper with usand he explained what's going on.He's written a great paper that really,it's just mind blowing how smart he isbecause he talks about primer dimers and melting pointsand oh my gosh, this is just great.I gotta put my name on this paper for surebecause we gotta end this shit.And that was in 2020 and it's been going on for four years.That player has been on my stream twice,trying to tell me that I'm doing the right thingand explained to me how the RNA was not rightor that there are stop codons that can happenwith the chemical alterationsor that there could be frame shifts.And the moment he couldn't convince methat RNA virology was definitely realand that infectious clones were just a distraction,as soon as he couldn't convince me of that,he had to block me on Twitter,had to start attacking me and calling me a fool,even though we were on a stream in March of 2023where I explained the clone theoryand he fumbled the ball like four times.So what do you mean, Jay?So what do you mean, Jay?I don't understand, Jay.I don't get it, Jay.What about XO-NJ?And every time he tried to lob something at me,I just kind of threw it back to himlike I already read that paper.No, not like that,'cause he was distorting the idea,trying to make it seem like I hadn't found what I had found,but that's really what we found.There is no doubt in my mindthat that's what those people up in the top cornerare hiding as well.Because if you're not sophisticated enough to saythat they've been lying about viruses,but the observations aren't fake,then you are essentially dismissing thousands and thousandsof human hours of work as fake instead of misinterpreted.Instead of being a very complicated pictureof biology of ourselves,where our immune system and all the tissues in our bodyduring health and disease communicate with small vesiclesthat contain genetic information on them,we have been led to believe that all of thisis outside of us and the only other alternativethat we've been given since the beginning of the pandemicis up there, which is that there are none of viruses at all.There are no signals at all, none of this.I don't, and the funny part is,is that I'm starting to get these emailswhere people say, "So those people up therehave explained where disease comes from already in 2020.What's your explanation for disease?"And now you see the other side of the trick.It is just like the clones thing.It is just like the PCR thing.It's just like transfection.They want you, after having called 911,before they're gonna believe youthat there's some crime happening,they want you to explain the detailsof the motivation of the murderer.They want you to explain the motivationsof the person that just broke into your house.They want you to explain why it is that the attackerthat you're calling the criminalis doing what he or she is doing.They don't want, they want an explanation.And so if you say that virology has been lying,now all of a sudden that it's my obligationto explain disease, imagine that.Imagine if you said, for example,that I don't think that what they said happenedon 911 happened and that no one would listen to youuntil you had an explanation for it.And that's the joke, right?That's the joke.Because there are no viruses and water in 5Gand tie in all those things togetherwith some mealy mouth 10 minute presentationdoesn't make knowledge.It doesn't make understanding.And my argument would be just like Mike Eden's,we're not sophisticated enough right nowto be able to just pull our heads outand then know how disease works.If these people and their mentorsand their mentors before them have been lyingabout this biology for a couple of decades,we're not gonna just be able to go,oh yeah, it's this instead.And that's what's the problem with those people.That's the trap that they represent.You're not gonna usefully help your childrenby telling them that these are the biologistsyou should pay attention to.You're gonna help your children by telling themthat they themselves need to work hardto understand what's going on.They themselves need to seek out the sacredand the irreducible complexity of our biologybecause having someone like themor someone like these people over therehelp you out with it, you will never find it.I would argue you would be better off doing yogatrying to find the sacred biology in yourselfor meditation or playing basketballor trying to get into crossfitand see if you can work out hard enoughto vomit a couple of timesbefore you realize how connected your mind and body are.Before you realize how much of a symphony of biologythe creator gave you and you have not been using itbecause social media divorces your body from your mind.That sitting on a chair eight hours a daydoesn't just ruin your back why I'm standing today,but it also divorces your mind from your body.Body was a temple was something my grandma used to always sayto me, you never hear that now.I don't hear my kids fied teachers telling them that.It's actually terrifying how long I can stay on this slidebecause this is the reality in which we live right now.This is it, this is the answer.And there are some people over here on the screenthat could be pulled out of this group,could be pulled out of the some of them,I think could be pulled out.Kevin McKernan will never wake upbecause he has been a part of this.He used to work for the Department of Energy, ladies and gentlemenas part of the Human Genome Project,which was basically as secret as nuclear weapons for a while.And he was able to take some patents out of that workand sell them and make companies.And so his family, his brothers were richwhen his dad was already in biotech.And then the brothers all went onon the front of newspapers and stuff.These are not suffering individuals.These are individuals who are an intimate partof a real gear in this machine.And make no mistake about it,his interest in genetics of cannabisis his interest in using genetics in plantsis no different than its transplantism, right?It's messing around with stuffthat I'm pretty sure we shouldn't be messing around with.And he wants to go into virions,which are naked RNAs that can infect these plants.And it's probably true,but he will distort it as a pathogenic process.He will distort it as something that he has a solution for.He will distort it into something that he has tests for.And he knows he's gonna get away with it.He knows because they've already told himthis is the next thing.So, take care of this stuff.Make sure that everybody focuses on Buck Halterand the double-stranded DNA.And we'll take care of the rest.I'm sure he is absolutely one of the worst players in thisbecause he had too much contact with me for him not to be.It would be so easy for him to have called meand tried to be my friend,called me and tried to convince me of stuff,worked together to try and understand the subtletiesof what these so-called infectious clones,these pure DNA and RNA,transfections and transformations that they put on cell cultures,what could they really result in or not?But instead, he has fought tooth and nail to make surethat nobody ever looks at that again.And just make sure that he says APO back a few timesand tries to equivolate the use of DNAand RNA molecular clones,transforming and transfecting cell culturesas being basically a good proxy for virology,which is the central lie,more or less, I guess, that AIDS is based on,that human T-cell leukemia viruses and even XMRV,they're all based on these kinds of experimentsthat are essentially transformationand transfection experimentsthat these people have agreed to agreerepresent high fidelity virology.It's high fidelity because we make a pure moleculeso we can study it even better.They're not studying anything.They're not studying a phenomenon.They are creating a field which bamboozles usinto believing that biology that is most likely our ownand part of every other highly complex life form on the planetand pretend that it's totally a signal outside of us.And they all agree to be part of this governing structurethat's based on this mythology, every one of them.And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen,the idea, for example, that Robert Malone is madabout Sashalatipovas, fake,just like the idea that Robert Malone is madabout George Webb is fake.How could it possibly be that he's mad about George Webbwhen he puts links into George Webb's60 minutes episode in his sub-stack?And how could George Webb be a bad guyif George Webb says that Paul Cottrellis one of the biggest MD heroes,doctor heroes of the pandemic?And Robert Malone was on a podcast being interviewedby Paul Cottrell multiple times in 2021.Are we to believe that Paul Cottrell fooled Robert Maloneinto believing that he was a legitimate,legitimate medical care professional?Are we to believe that Robert Malone was fooledby that other dude that was hosting the show,whatever it was called, black and white podcast, what?Is that what we're supposed to believe,just like we were supposed to believethat Robert Malone got lied to by Peter Cullisabout the localization of the lipid nanoparticle?And that's the only reason why he took itbecause he was well aware that that was a problem.And he wouldn't have taken itbecause he knew that was a problem,except Peter Cullis told him that they'd solved that problem.So he took the shot.So he didn't say that Peter lied,but he kind of said Peter liedbecause we have a video of Peter in 2022saying that we never solved that problem.He admitted it in an open lecture, 2022.So it's strange that Peter would have said thatto Robert Malone unless maybe somebody lied to Peter.Maybe Peter's not that smart.Maybe Peter's kind of naive.And if somebody said, "Oh, it works,"then he would say, "Wow, that's great."And open a Scotch before he ever thoughtvery deeply about it, it's possible.But then we're supposed to believe what?That he forgot his card when he went to Romewith Steven Hatfield,or that Steven Hatfield tells that story, but it's a lie?Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Malone's story doesn't add up.Robert Malone's behavior doesn't add up.Robert Malone's story changes over the three yearsthat he became public.And a lot of these people down there,they all seem to ignore it.They don't want to admit it.Think about the fact that Kevin McCarron,some clown in Japan who has been sayingthat there might be a billion people deadand has been saying that it's a gain of function lab leaksince it was ridiculously cool to say it in 2020,has been saying worst case scenariosince the very beginning.And now his worst case scenario involves a virusand the combination of a bio weapon injectionthat was designed to work together or something.Think about that guy right therehas no critiques for Robert Malone.That guy there who opposed Paul Cottrell in 2020because I was on streams with him,I've got recordings we could watch.That guy who was communicating mewith behind the scenes with phone callsand our emails talking about how we should make surewe oppose some of these ideas of Paul Cottrell together.This guy has made no criticisms of Robert Malone at all.It's like he doesn't even exist,even though he is used hours and hours to make fun of me.And his mean people have used hours and hoursto make fun of me.Kevin McCarron won't touch Robert Malone.Won't touch him.Ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is it.I think this is the brick wall, what you see right here.In the interview with Paul Cottrell in 2021,Robert Malone refers to the intellectual dark web.And refers to it as a good thing.Refers to himself as being a part of it.Ladies and gentlemen, they didn't thinkwe were gonna get this far.They didn't think that we were actually gonna figure it out.They didn't think that Mark and Iwould ever take each other seriously.And they were working very hardbehind the scenes to make sure we wouldn't.Somebody told Mark very early on that I was a fake Christian.Somebody told me very early on that I should be carefulof Mark because he's so connected to George Webband George Webb is definitely an idiot.And that was pretty obvious to me.So I was pretty worried about Mark.And then at some point George Webb had an absolute meltdownand did a Twitter space where he called both Mark and Ireally bad names and said that we were terriblefor having attacked Paul Cottrelland calling out Paul Cottrell as a fake.He totally doubled down on Paul Cottrell.So now there you have it.There's no, it's no more mistaking it anymore.The list that Robert Malone put out was a fake list.And the list included peoplethat I've always identified as bad.And people didn't believe me.Including Mary Holland on the list.Including George Webb on the list.Including Sasha Latapova on the list.All fake.It's all part of the same network of bullshit.Designed to create a lala palooza of dissidentsthat you could choose a particular stage fromand watch and never get your kids out.That's what this is.That's why Polly, the amazing Polly,hasn't gotten this far.It's just the wellness company and a bunch of peopleon the new narrative network.It's too big of a picture.Jimmy Dorr and Russell Brand,maybe already playing for the same groupof weaponized piles of money.But what I need you to see is that there is a very specificgroup of people that has controlled the COVID narrative.A very specific group of peoplethat has been there to control the COVID narrativethat is separate and different from these monkeysthat were put in place at the beginning of the pandemicand before to be just kind of generally present.These podcasts like Joe Rogan and Brett Weinsteinand Eric Weinstein and Shapiro and Rubinand Pool and Cedar and all this bros with showson the internet were put there to be like nightly news stations.They weren't put there to be experts on particular things.That's why Brett Weinstein is casting such a large netof evolutionary biology and the kinds of thingsthat he can apply the evolutionary paradigm to.Complex systems is my specialty.So I can talk about whatever I want to.That's because he's a nightly news intellectual,dark web, professional,slaver working for the weaponized piles of moneythat are enslaving us,that are slowly executing a controlled demolitionof the republics of the West.And they are playing for those teams.That's why Robert Malone and Andrew Huffdid some podcast together until we shreddedAndrew Huff and now they pretty much can't do that anymore.That's why he stopped working with Paul Cottrellbecause that didn't work out.They were off script a long time ago, ladies and gentlemen.They were off script a long time agobecause they didn't get 80 or 90% non-compliancein the first year like they hoped they would.The zero COVID arguments that were being madedidn't take like they hoped they would.People like Mike Yedin and Wolfgang Wodach.And in America, you can really easy forgetthat Knut Wodkowski also spoke out very vehementlyabout reopening schools in 2020 and they wrecked him.They wrecked him.And they don't want you to know it.None of these people want you to know that.Jay Badacharia and the rest of the Great Barrington Declarationdon't want you to realize that Knut Wodkowski said itmonths before they did and pointed out why.And they were still arguing for a lockdown of old peopleand probably for the application of the vaccineto old people.They were not the resistors that we were told they werebecause they also supported thisand edified this limited spectrum of debateand never questioned the idea of a pandemicin the first place.Even though they were epidemiologistsand could have had the dataor could have called out the factthat we don't have enough dataor that the data in New York is weird.And they didn't.Don't you see?They didn't.They still haven't done it.These amazing epidemiologists that supposedly were smartenough to put the Great Barrington Declarationyet still ignore Jessica Hockettand the now public data in New Yorkthat doesn't fit their basic modelsof respiratory viral spread.You don't think Gupta or Batachara or Koldorfcould look at that and go,"Wow, maybe Jessica's right."That's what I see.And I don't want to be this guy,but nobody's helping usbecause nobody's talking about the bodiesthat were floating in the pool from the very beginning.(upbeat music)Everybody's pretending that the drownings didn't happenin order to scare people into taking a life jacket.Even though the pool is only four feet deepand it's full of bodies,we've been told that all those people died in the poolbecause they didn't have their life jacket on.But their heads were all held under the waterbefore you got there.And we were told that if you don't put on a life jacket,we could all drown in this pool.But the pool had, and we same time,we have people arguing,"No way the pool could drown us.The pool is only six inches deep.They're totally lying about the danger of the pool."No, they're lying about the factthat the people who were dead in the pool were murdered.Trying to pretend that they don't really knowwhy those people are dead,but whoever they're dead,they didn't die from the waterso we don't need life preservers.So then how did they die?They were murdered and those people can't say murder.Those people over there can't say murder.Nobody says murder,but this guy and this guy and that guy,and they don't even really say murder.Only I do and Mark.And we do need to say it.We do need to say that they killed peopleto create this illusion.I think Mike Eden should saythat they killed people to create the illusion.I think also Thomas Binder and Denny Rancor,the only conclusion you can come toif there wasn't a risk additive,novel spreading pathogen in any of the data that we seeis that they lied about it.And in order to lie about it, they needed excess deaths.And so they needed to find as many ways as possibleto create those excess deathsand then put people in placeto make sure that we didn't ask the right questionsthat would find those excess deaths.(mouse clicking)I have seen the alien, ladies and gentlemen.And so every day I gotta spend a little timeworking through telling peoplethat I've seen the alien that they can't see.And so I apologize if this gets tiring,but it's just the way it's gonna be.And so we're always gonna have show at like 11 o'clockbecause 10 o'clock to 11 o'clockis always gonna be trying to recapitulate this,trying to catch another personto understand how effective it is when two people lie to you.Nevermind four or five or six or sevenor eight or a hundred,which is closer to where we were in the pandemicwith people like Nurse Aaron and Paul Cottrelland George Webb and Robert Malone and Merrill Nassand Steve Kirsch and Herit Bundenboschand Andrew Huff and McCurn and Corey.All of these people who have chosen to tellone little part of the story,never question RNA virology,never use the word transfectionand completely ignore me since about 2023when I finally could succinctly explainwhy RNA virology might be a problemand why these people might be working very hardto make sure that we don't actually figure it out.That was like annoying.They didn't like it and neither did theythat I could say, well, actually you both might be right.And maybe if we could get togetherunder the understanding of what RNA virology is,then maybe we would get there, none of them.None of them want that, none of them wanted it.Thank you.And that's a problem.And that's a continuing problem.We're always gonna have this problem.This is always gonna be the story now.I don't think they have any more permutations of the story.There's no more moves they can make.What are they gonna do?Bring some more actors out to oppose?Some more actors to say, oh, it's the shots.Oh my goodness, it's the lipid nanoparticle.I'm sure the lipid nanoparticle is also nasty.I'm sure of it.But you don't think Robert Malone could have known thatbecause Peter Cullis lied to me,otherwise I would have knownthat the lipid nanoparticle was also dangerous.Isn't that the conclusion that we should come to,given what he just said on Steve Kirsch's podcastthree days ago?That podcast with Steve Kirsch is gonna be neededto be erased, that's how bad it is.Because Robert Malone thinks, I think somehowthat he, that nobody sees, but we see it.And a lot of people are starting to see it.And that's why I think in that podcast,they had to triple down on the idea that nobody sees itand that I'm just a legendary whistleblower,which is how Steve Kirsch treats him.Or at least titles that is an absolute laughing stockto me right now.It's a laughing stock to me.Sashalatapova is a laughing stock.I mean, George Webb is a laughing stock.And I really do believe that Robert Maloneis an absolute laughing stock.We are being manipulated on the dissident sideby people that the rest of the world doesn't even know exist.And we've been arguing with them when the rest of the worlddoesn't even know they exist.Most normal skilled TV watchers have no cluethat any of these performers even exist.And yet we've been wasting all of our timetrying to convince them that our ideas mean somethingor that people were murdered.And we keep thinking that they're listening to usfor three years, but they were never, ever, ever,ever going to say what needed to be said.And I am one of the few peoplewho knows exactly how malevolent they've beenbecause I know how long they've known.Some of them have known for more than three and a half years.And that should make you so pissed off,you can barely breathe.Ladies and gentlemen, they lied about a dangerous novel virus.And if you wanna understand why,you have to use infectious cloneas a search term on PubMed.It's not that it's a great term,it's a term that they made up,so it's just as dumb as the infectious cycle cartoon.But infectious clone is the way to use PubMedto understand how this illusionwas created over many decades.(upbeat music)(upbeat music)- If Dell is asking the wrong questions under coercionor asking the wrong questions under duress,then Dell could be a good guy.There's lots of other people in ICANN though.And Aaron Siri is one of them.Aaron Siri is interestingbecause he never talks about the BICP or the CICP,in these two kangaroo courtsthat they deal with vaccine injuries.And he's never talked about themas being a seventh amendment violationof our constitutional right to sue or damages, never.And he doesn't talk very oftenabout how we could just strike the prep actby trying to get a case to pursue that.And why is that?I believe because you kinda have a conflict of interestif you bring cases to the CICP or the VICP as a lawyer,you can't really then also simultaneously saythat that's unconstitutionalbecause by taking people to that court,you essentially are telling them that it's legitimate.And then you can't at the same timeas you counsel them to use that court,also in another way, say that that court's unconstitutional.It's very conflicting.And then on top of that, of course,you may or may not be aware,but the CICP and the VICP are the only placein the legal system where the losing lawyersare also fully compensated for their time.I want you to think just carefullyabout what that ethically creates for lawyers.And if you can't get there in a couple seconds,I'll tell you.But part of the reason why it's difficult to bring suit,if you're not a lawyer,is because you need to hire a lawyer to do it.And if the lawyer thinks that they're gonna lose,then they obviously knowthat they will not get their fees paid.So lawyers in the real world of criminal laware under some professional constraintto take cases that they think they can win.Whereas in the CICP and the VICP,there is no reason to do thatbecause even if you know the case is gonna lose,you could spend hundreds of hours on it and bill it all.And the crazy part is,is that before a decision is made,they'll already pay you.(mouse clicking)I mean, the problem with this is,is that I wanna do other things.I wanna bring other ideasand be positive every morning for you.But we are in a dire situation right now.And so it's of utmost importance to meto get this off of my chest every dayand to take another swing at expressing these ideas.Because I really do,I have come to believe it with all of my heart and soul.And that's why I'm putting my familyin front of this train.Because I think that they have been under the realizationthat this whole charade was about to breakand that Trump's election may have been,I don't know.I do know that whatever is happening right nowis not something that started in 2020with confusion,but started in 2020 as a continuumof a plan that had started earlierthat included people in place on the internetso that when that pandemic was declared,the illusion of consensus would be absolute.And the illusion of consensus would not be absolute on TV,but also on social media.So get ready for an extreme gear shiftas we move from saying,"Stop lying!"to moving to saying,"Stop lying!"And in this case,we are gonna move to saying stop lyingwith the idea of mindless statistics.So this talk that we're gonna watch todayis by Gert Gigerrenzer,who is a German who I had the privilege to meetin April of this yearat the Broken Science Initiative meeting in 2024.Thanks to the generous Greg Glassman,who has been allowing me to participate in this initiativeand interact with some of the peoplethat are providing the content and ideaslike Malcolm Kendrick and Richard Kimballand Matt Briggs,and also Gert Gigerrenzer,who I actually had the hilarious privilegeof riding around in a Waymo in Arizonawhile I was there with him,'cause he really wanted to try the no driving car,but you need to have a cell phone in America to do it.And so I volunteered to take himand it was kind of a fun ride.And then it dropped us off ridiculously far from our hotelbecause it didn't have any potential place to park.We didn't know how to use it and it's weird.And so it suggested to drop us off somewherenearby our hotel.And then we had like a 20 more minute walk anyway.And so I actually,in the brief period of time that I was in Arizonafor that meeting got to know Gert quite wellbecause then the next day we saw each other again.And of course we were good buddiesand he heard that my wife was Dutchand that we lived in Holland and so on that walkand that ride we became sort of,I don't know if we became friends,but I'm pretty confident that Gert will be on the showat some point.We've already agreed that that will happen,but I wanted to make sure that I give adequateintroduction to him.I don't wanna have him come on the showand give a talk that he's already givenwhen we could learn and see that talkand then look at some of his papers before we have him onso that we could have some kind of advanced discussionabout what he does.So this is Gert Giger-Enzerand I think it's gonna be a nice talk.I think you'll enjoy it a lot.There's a little time there where some long hairis in the way of the cameraand don't think that's me because that's me.So this was recorded with me in the roomand in the question and answer I asked a question,but I don't think it's as good a question as,it's not formulated as well as it could be.So I might not allow this to go all the way to the endbecause I don't think it's necessary.The main thing I wanna do is introduce you to Gertand introduce you to his idea,which he's been publishing about for quite some time.And that, oh, sorry, I didn't need to do that.Darn it, darn it, darn it.I have this new setup here, not new setup,but I had the opportunity to bring a screenfrom the Mac over here.And so I have the video on this side.So that means I can go back and forth between my slideswhenever I want to without having to drop them back and forth.It's just slightly better than it used to be.It's just, you know, me having fun.Gotta make this fun somehow besides the funny noises.Is that plain play?Today I will talk about a strikingly persistent phenomenonin the social and biomedical sciences.Mindless statistics.Let me begin with a story.Herbert Simon is the only personwho have received both the Nobel Prize in Economicsand the Turing Award in Computer Science,the two highest distinctions in both disciplines.Shortly before he died--- That's my head.- Herbert sent me a letter in which he mentionedwhat has frustrated him almost more than anything elseduring his scientific career.- I'll speed it up, just a little bit.- Significance testing.Now he wrote, "The frustration does not lie"in the statistical test themselves,"but in the stubbornness with which social scientists"hold a misapplication that is consistently denounced"by professional statisticians."Herbert Simon was not alone.The mathematician, Orn Duncan Doos,spoke of mindless hypothesis testingin lieu of doing good science.The experimental psychologist, Edwin Boring,spoke of a meaningless ordeal of pedantic calculation.And Paul Meal, the academic psychologistand former president of the American Psychological Societycalled Significance Testing,one of the worst things that have ever happened to psychology.What is going on?Why these emotions?What could be wrong with what most psychologists,social scientists, and biomedical scientists are doing?In this talk, I will explain what is going wrong.The institutionalization of a statistical ritualinstead of good statistics.I will explain what the ritual is.I will explain how it fuels the replication crisis,how it brings blind spots in the mind of the researchers,and also how it creates a conflict for researchers,young and old, between doing good scienceand doing everything to get a significant result.Okay, so I wanna stop it here.- Let me give an example.A few years ago, I gave a lecture on scientific methods.- Sorry, I had to do it that way.I forgot what computer I was using, so there you go.I'm gonna turn my voice down a little bitbecause I have your Gert turned up.I just wanna throw out a question there for you,just to make sure that we're all on the same page here.Just to ask you a question really simply.If I say that I did an experimentand the p-value is below 0.05,does that mean that if I do the experiment again,95% of the time I will get the same result?Yes or no?So p-value of 0.05 means that if I did this experiment again,95% of the time I would get this result,or does it mean that only 5% of the timeI would get this result?It's actually neither, right?It's neither.And that's one of the things that I,as an academician, a well-trained academiciandidn't understand when I was doing it.I thought that the whole idea was to take enough measurementsuntil there was a p-value that was significant,and then that when the p-value became significant,now you had knowledge, now you had an observationthat was worth talking about.And I didn't understand what I was doing,that this was a ritual that had something to dowith a hidden, no hypothesis that was absolute bullshit.And so I'm hoping that that's what Gertzgonna bring through here,is the idea that we have been consciouslyand intelligently manipulated as a species,as a population for decades,and unfortunately that includes at the academy level,where we have been bamboozled into believingthat statistics can be used as a way of discerning knowledgefrom noise and distilling knowledge into understanding,and it's completely wrong.So I'm really excited to do this show.Go ahead.- I'm also on the important of trust and honesty in science.After I finished, in the discussion session,a student from an Ivy League university stood up and said,told me, you can afford to follow the rules of science.I can't, I have to publish and get a job.My own advisor tells me to do anythingto get a significant result.That's known as slicing and dicing data,or also pee hacking.- So, it'd be interesting to go back to virologyand find how often they actuallydidn't even care about statistics.It'd be very interesting to go back to virologyand see how many of those papers were not doing this,but we don't have time to do that today.- The student is not to blame.He was honest, but he has to go through a ritualthat is not in the service of science.So let me start with the replication crisis.So every couple of weeks, the media proclaimsthe discovery of a new tumor markerthat promises personalized diagnosticor even treatment of cancer.- Here we go.- And medically research, tumor research,is even more productive.Every day, four to five studies reportat least one significant new marker.And nevertheless, despite this mass of results,few have been replicated and even fewerhave been put into clinical practice.When a team of hundred scientistsat the biotech company, Ungem, tried to replicatethe findings of 53 landmark studies,they succeeded only with six.When the pharmaceutical company, Bayer,examined 67 projects on oncology, women's health,and cardiovascular medicine,they were able to replicate only 14.So what do you do when your doctor prescribesyour drug based on a randomized trialsthat showed that's efficient,but then it seems to fade away.Now, medically research seems to be preoccupiedby producing non reproducible results.Ian Chalmers, one of the founders of the Cochrane Societyand Paul Clasham, chair of the International Societyfor Evidence-Based Health Care,estimated that 85% of medically researchis avoidably wasted.And they estimated a loss of $170 billionevery year worldwide.So that's a great way to enslave people, isn't it?It would be a great way to create a mythology,would be to spend $170 billion every yearon bullshit research.And that's what they do.They spend billions of dollars every yeargetting people to study like genetic correlationswith autism in models in mice.Genetic models of autism in mice,which presuppose the idea that one particular genemight play a role.And so if we knock out that geneor alter that gene in this mouseand it has some p-value measurable differencein its behavior that we can call it a model of autism.And then people after us can call it a model of autism.And then people after us will believethat this gene has something to do with autism.And then eventually we can have some do...Oh, I can't get down.(indistinct)Eventually we can have some dude.Oh, it's even cramping in my hamstrings.It's all just a bad right side.In 2016, write a bullshit bookthat says the environmental and genetic causes of autism.Instead of a book that says, you know,vaccination is a criminal,the vaccination schedule is criminal in Americaand we should do something about it.It's like, you know, make it open.Maybe it's even viruses for all I know,James Lyons-Wiler might think that too.That's how much of a fraud I think he is.And it's unfortunate because IPAChas a lot of people that like them.And I'm sure there are probably lots of peoplethat are really nice at IPAC.But what's this guy's problem for me?This bullshitter knew about the fear and cleavage siteand wrote a blog post about it in February of 2020.And there's no way in God's green earth,you can convince me that this charlatan knewthat the fear and cleavage site,which is only a few bases,was a significant indicator of a lab leak.He was given that tip,just like he was told right this bookand it'll be great because it'll make the autism momsfeel like somebody's listening to them,but it also won't threaten the vaccine schedule at all.And I think you'll find that pattern holds trueeven with other book companies.You'll see, they might publish an anti-Bax bookand then they'll publish a couplebullshit books alongside of it.And I think this guy is fakebecause of the fear and cleavage site.Before that, I didn't really know.But he used to live in Pittsburgh.For all of 2020, he lived in Pittsburgh.And guess who he wouldn't talk to for 2020?That's right, J.C. on a bike.Guess who this guy never shook hands withall the times we saw each other at CHD conferences.Guess who just smiled and walked past?James Lyons Weiler.When I send emails about him,I call him James Lyon Weiner.Because I think he's one of the fakestof all these dissidents and he was put in placedoing all his bullshit during the timewhen Bax came out, during the time when,unfortunately on the Today Show,a Hollywood movie star called out some bullshit,that momentum needed control, ladies and gentlemen.They needed to vent some of that.And so they vented through people like James Lyon Weiner.They vented through stupid booksthat don't actually tell you the truth.Who little did you know,they have encouraged those people to write those books.All my back and hamstrings are killing me right nowon my right side.It's brutal.I don't know if I'm gonna make it through this.I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be a weak ass.I'm trying to say that might need to rest.I put my leg up here on this table.Ships, okay, I'm just gonna keep going.But I can go on and on about thisbecause they're obvious now.You know, the first person to write aboutJames Lyon's Weiner's blog about the fear and cleavage site,it was one of the first citationsin Harvard to the Big House's original articleabout the lab leak that got published on Zero Hedgeand that he actually linked to my bike rides in.That's right.Now you see it.And who did Dan Sarotkin,who did his dad work for, Los Alamos Laboratories?That's not just nobody, ladies and gentlemen.He worked on genetic sequencing algorithms.So that's somebody who could definitely knowthat transfection and transformationwould have been pretty stupid and healthy individuals.And yet his son is the guythat was supposedly blowing the whistle the earliest.His son, I mean, if,and then that's how I got involved in drastic in 2020.That's how I got involved in the day tradingwith these people on Slackand that I realized that Yuri Dagan had to be fakebecause he was in that day trading group.But he blocked me and threw me out of his group of drasticbecause I didn't wanna talk about the origins of the virus.I wanted to talk about transfection and transformation.(soft music)See, ladies and gentlemen,we are being lied to consistently to cover up somethingthat has needed covering up for a lot longerthan the start of the pandemic.It's billions of wasted dollars being used activelyto create the illusion of pandemic potential,to create the illusion of the need for public health,to create the illusion of genetic causesof all these diseases.And therefore we need to look at your genes.We need your genes, we need your databecause it's all genetics.It can't be the pollution,it can't be the processed food,it can't be the shitty pharmaceuticals that we prescribeinstead of helping you to get healthier.It's gotta be viruses, it's gotta be disease,it's gotta be public health, it's gotta be your broken.And that's what Garrett is referring toat the helicopter level about how this is done.It's just done because if you want to be malevolentand this is the way science is done,it's pretty easy to be malevolent.It doesn't mean all scientists are malevolent,it doesn't mean all science is bad.It means exactly what I've said with regardto these people on the screen.See, this is where I think it'll be good'cause I can just go back and get up here.(silence)That's exactly what all these people did, they tricked us.And so when I say that these people are protecting something,I'm talking about all of these people right here.They are protecting something,the people on that T-shirt screen.And part of what they are protecting is this illusionthat knowledge has been created over these many years.Why do I say that?Because Kevin McKernan is one of the peoplewho has to protect the most.Because as I've been calling out off and on on this stream,I believe that the human genome project was a lie.I'm not saying they didn't do anything.I'm saying what they said they didand what they actually did is not the same.And Mark Lander and some of these peoplehave been telling us for years.They made some landmarks, they found some landmarksthat they can use to look at one genome to the other genome.They didn't sequence the whole human genomeand now they know where all the genes are.They made restriction enzyme maps of the human genomethat would allow them to compare those landmarksacross other human genomes.That's what they did, make no mistake about it.Any other details to that may have come later.But the way that genomic association studies are donewhere you can blame a genetic cause on autismis done with these magic tricksand these rituals of statisticsthat identify the genes in the first place.And then if you make a knockout mouse of a geneand it has some behavioral phenotype,would you really be surprised?And yet then you go on and you test the p-value differencebetween the wild type mouse and the knockout mouseand since there's a significant difference,now you've created knowledgeand maybe even a model of autism.Please see how malevolent it isthat people like me get trained in such a waythat we could actually get sucked into thisand become part of this systemwhere everybody just agrees this is the way it is.You just gotta get good at itso that nobody thinks you're doing it badly.If you cut the sausage welland can make the story good,then you're considered a great scientist.If you don't cut the story so well,then you just don't get tenure.But if you can find a way to make it work for you,this system is greatand that's what a lot of these people have done.I'm gonna have to quit sooner.I'm gonna have to figure out another way to get going here.Maybe I need to drink more water.Okay, so I'm going back to this oneand we'll get this going.The discovery that too many scientific resultsappear to be false alarmshas been baptized the replication crisis.In recent years--- I do, I do.I think that's very right.I think it's very good that the RANOS failed.It's very good.That would have been a disaster.- Often young researchers have tried to systematically--- It could have also failed on purposeto make sure that we think thatwhen people are frauds, they get caught.And when people aren't frauds, they don't get caught.They succeed.They could have also been that kind of thing.- To what degree the problem is.And typically the results show thatbetween a third and two thirds of published findingscannot be replicated.And among those who can be replicated,the effect size is on average half.So in medical research, for instance,the efficacy of antidepressantsplummeted drastically from study to study.And second generation antipsychoticsthat earned Eli Lilly a fortuneseem to lose their efficacy when retested.- Which would explain why a lot of these antidepressantswould be wanting to be recycled as repurposed drugsby people like Steve Kirsch or Robert Malonewho have been working for these same weaponized pilesof money their whole lives.Right?Make perfect sense.Let's take something that we know didn't work for one thingand see if we can repurpose it for another.Why didn't it work?Well, because depression was defined by P values.Because depression was defined by P values.Therefore you could measure the depressionin a subjective way and then orchestrate P valuesand then sell products.Billions of dollars were at stake.Of course they'll fake shit.And we can do it with the statistical ritual of P hacking.- It's interesting how the scientific community reacted.So what would it do if your resultthat made you famous disappears?Some researchers like the psychologist,Jonathan Schouler, faced the problemand tried to think about what's the reason.And Jonathan came up with the idea of cosmic habituation.In his words, "It was as if nature gave me this great result"and then tried to take it back."- Unbelievable.- The New Yorker called this the truth wears off phenomenon.- Truth wears off.- Uses.- Reacted, so other researchers reacted differently.And we're not happy with those who tried to replicatetheir studies and failed and waged personal attacks on those.Speaking of, I quote, "Replication police,"shameless little bullies, which hunts"or compare them to the stasi."- Nice.- So here we are at the beginning of the 21st century,one of the most cited claims in the social andbiomedical sciences was John E. Honidus,most scientific results for course.In 2017, just to give a hint about the possiblepolitical consequences, the news website,brightpart.com, headlander claim by Wharton School,Professor Scott Armstrong, that I quote,"Fewer than 1% of papers in scientific journals"follow scientific method."End of quote.Now, we have seen in this country and also other countries,politicians trying to cut down funding of research.And if they would read more about this,there would be more going in this direction.And those who point out that so many results are notreplicable, they face a double problem.They want to save science at the same timeto run the danger that maybe Donald Trump,someone else, will use this to cut funding totally down.- Oh, that's an interesting thing.- So how did we get there?The replication crisis has been blamed on economic,on false economic incentives like published in Paris.And I want to make a point today that we need to gobeyond the important role of external incentivesand focus on an internal problem that fuelsthe replication crisis.And this is the factor that good scientific practicehas been replaced by a statistical ritual.My point is, researchers follow this ritual not because,or not only because of external pressure, no.They have internalized the ritualand many generally believe in it.And that can be seen most clearly by the delusionsthey have about the P value, the product of the ritual.So statistical methods are not just applied to a science.They can change the entire science.So think about parapsychology,which once was to study.- I'm gonna just answer a question in the chat.GigaOM does not have anything to do with G proteins.G proteins are a protein signaling mechanismpart of G protein coupled receptors.And so no, GigaOM means Giga as in,I think it's a million, like GigaWatte in the movie,in the movie Back to the Future, GigaWatts 1.21 GigaWatts.Well, GigaOMs is not Watts, but it's OMS.So it's an amount of resistance.It's GigaWatts.He said GigaWatts, but it's really GigaWatts.Oh, sorry.The message is by the deal departed.And it turned into the study of repetitive corp guessing,because that's what the statistical method demanded.In a similar way, the social sciences have been changedby the introduction of statistical inference.And typically social science,scientists first encountered Sir Ronald Fisher's theories.And particular his 1935 book, he wrote three books.The first was too much about agriculture and manure,and technically too difficult for most social scientists,but the second one was just right.And it didn't smell anymore.And so they started writing textbooks.And then they became aware of a competing theoryby the Polish statistician, Jersey Naiman,and the British statistician, Egon Pearson.The Fisher had a theory, so at least his non-apostas testing,where he had just one hypothesis,Naiman insisted that you need two.Fisher had the P-value computed after the experiment.Naiman and Pearson insisted everything in advance.I'll just give you an idea about the fundamental differences,and I'll give you an idea about the flavorof the controversy.Fisher branded Naiman's theory as childish,and horrifying for the freedom of the West.And linked Naiman Pearson's theoryto Stalin's five year program.Also to Americans who cannot distinguish,or don't want to distinguish,within making money and doing science.Incidentally, Naiman was born in Russiaand moved to Berkeley in the US.So, and Naiman, for his part,responded to some of Fisher's tests and said,"These are in a mathematically-specifiable sense,worse than useless."What he meant was that,that the power was smaller than alpha,such in the famous Lady T test.So, what do textbook writers dowhen there are two different ideasabout statistically inference?One solution would have been, you present both.And maybe also base, or tooky, and others,and teach researchers to use their judgment,to develop a sense in what situation is that working,and where it's better to do this.No, that was not what textbook writers were going for.They created a hybrid theory of statistical inferencethat didn't exist and doesn't exist in statistics proper.Taking some parts from Fisher, some parts from Naiman,and adding their own parts,mostly about the idea that scientific inferencemust be without any judgment.That's what I mean, mindless, automatic.- Mm-hmm, there it is.And the essence of this hybrid theory is the null ritual.- All right.- The null ritual has three steps.- This is the perfect part.- Set up a null hypothesis of no mean differencesor zero correlation.And most important, do not specifyyour own hypothesis or theory.Know its prediction.Second step, use 5% as a conventionfor rejecting the null hypothesis.If the test is significant, claim victoryfor your hypothesis that you have never specified.If the test result, and report the test results as P,smaller than 5% or 1% or 0.1%,whichever level is met by due results.And the third step is a unique step.It says, always perform this procedure, period.Now, Lisa Fisher, know to be sure,name and Pearson would have approved of this procedure.And Fisher, for instance, said,"No scientific researcher will ever have the same level"of significance from experiment to experiment."You will give us thoughts, name and also."And Pearson emphasized the role of judgment.- Okay, so before we go any farther,I just want to give you one example of thisso that you know exactly what I'm fricking talking about'cause I'm getting pissed.I'm getting angry.And I don't like to be angry.But that's what I feel right now.I feel anger because people are not seemingto pay attention anymore.And when you don't pay attention anymore,then you abdicate those responsibilities to others.And that drives me absolutely bananas.And so let's see if I can find this videothat I was watching already.I guess it would have been this one here.- And DEX is a great way to stabilizeand get out the door.And that is one way that it's usedin some hospital and server.And it, but in with the tight relationships thereand their lock.- So let's just look, you know,because that's what we really are trying to do.I don't want to take anything away from Gert.Okay, that's not my plan.I want you to pay close attention to Gert.But Gert is giving us a 30,000 foot view of a systemfrom which these people have emerged.And in fact, they are trying to protect.So what I want to do is just listen to a random,portion of this to see if we can find any timeswhen Robert Malone will refer to p-values as knowledge.Okay.And it's very interesting'cause we just heard Gert kind of explainin a German sort of way why randomized control trialsdon't give you any information.And in fact, the worst, they are designedthe worst information that they will give you.And they often don't even test a hypothesis.So in the case of COVID, if you assume there's COVIDand then you look for statistical differencesbetween two groups when there is no COVID,what are you finding?And of course that would have been what these peoplewere involved in from the very beginningby assuming there's COVIDand then doing clinical trialsand reporting significant results,you are using paparian falsification of a null hypothesis,which is what?Well, if there was no difference between these two groups,then the statistics would show it.And since the statistics show differencebetween these groups,then I guess my repurposed drug works.So it'd be crazy, right?If in August of 2021,talking to the obviously fake Paul Cottrell live,still on YouTube,does anybody else not find it strangethat this video wouldn't get a strikejust because Robert Malone is supposedlythis ultra censored guy?That a month before this,Brett Weinstein lost the monetization of his channeland his income to his family was threatenedbecause he put his life on the lineand his livelihood on the lineto give Robert Malone a place to talk on his stream.Isn't it kind of strikingthat this bullshit is still up on YouTube?(faintly speaking)'Cause it is, it's just that Mark's re-uploading them again.You see the problem here?Mark does a stream about Stanley Plotkinand Hillary Koprowski and it gets a strike,but then what?Talks about murder, he gets a strike,but Paul Cottrell and Daryl Neelydiscussing the finer points of the pandemicwith Robert Malone is totally okay, even though what?I guess Robert Malone wasn't very off narrative then, was he?Let's listen to this because this first 10 minutesof this video is freaking unbelievable.Remember who he's talking to,he's talking to Paul Frickin' Cottrelland somebody who was definitely at January 6th,just like George Webb was, for example.Let's just go from the beginning.I know it's not more than 15 minutes of thisbefore we're gonna be absolutely shocked.- Mark vaccines under Maurice Hillmanfor about nine million bucks.Then Mark failed to deliver and develop a product,given back to Viscal.They continued to try to develop productsfor about 20 for the rest of their life in the patentand while keeping other people from doing it.And then finally the patents expiredand the field took off.So meanwhile, I did a lot of additional work.My wife and I were issued a fundamental patentthat covered all vector technologyfor vaccine purposes by internasalor mucosal administration.So this covered adenoviral vectors, AAB or other methodsas well as mRNA and DNA.So we have the broad patent for polynucleotide mucosal.- So he wants you to believe that he has the patentfor everything.He has the actual intellectual property patentand it's expired I think.He wants you to believe he has the patent for AAB for mRNA.He came up with the whole idea of what?For me, it's very intellectually obvious.He came up with the idea of using transformationand transfection as a vaccine methodology.That's all.He came up with the idea and a lot of people tried itand it didn't work because of course it wouldn't work.But he came up with the idea and he's talking shitabout coming up with the idea,but not talking shit about standing up for the factthat we shouldn't have rolled out an AAB.Remember, he supposedly lost his career speaking outfor Jesse Gelsinger.I wonder if he's gonna say that to Paul Cottrellin August of '21 or if he's gonna wait until laterto whine about it later.Wine about it when everybody's forgottenwhat he has done in 2020or what he did before June of '21.These people are malevolent participantsworking for the slavers, ladies and gentlemen.- Vaccination and many other patents and products,licensed, marketed products having to dowith the Ketanic Lipid delivery technologyas well as delivery for vaccine purposesusing post-electrical fields.And we were involved in the initial incorporationof a company called Inovio,which is one of the other candidate technology platformsthat's currently being produced.Now, my understanding of that platformis that it's just presenting a protein.Inovio?Yeah, isn't it?No, no, no, no, we should.That's using post-electrical fieldsto deliver polymucous ties into skin and muscle.- Oh, okay, okay.So, so-- - So most of your--- So he's being interviewed by Paul Cottrell.This guy is one of the biggest shitheads out there.Maximum shithead.Because he had the actual shtick that he was doingat the beginning of 2020, including on streams with me,is that he was a doctor or a medical studentor some expert that knew a hell of a lot more than I did.And now this piece of shit is talking to Robert Malone.And Robert Malone is essentially renderinghis four-screen bullshit credibility.But he says that George Webb's a bad guy.Can't you see how ridiculously damning this video is?There's no other way to see it,'cause it wasn't the only time that he was on with them.There's no other way to see it.Robert Malone and Jill were duped by Paul Cottrelland by George Webb.Really?They are part of the same show.The exact same show.Let's say patents or research has been on the RNA moleculeor also the lipid nanoparticle technology.The structure of the RNA, the synthesis large scale,no one was ever doing large scale synthesis crosser 9/11.I've worked with virtually all of the major--Excuse me, excuse me.Excuse me, Mark Kulak, did you hear that?Did you hear it?Did you hear it, Mark?Before 9/11, nobody was doing large scale manufacturingof nucleotides and he helped all of them do it.Technique.The structure of the RNA, the synthesis large scale,no one was ever doing large scale synthesis crosser 9/11.I've worked with virtually all of the major vaccine candidatesfor biotefense purposes.I was at the tip of the spear in bringingthe Public Health Agency Canada vaccine forwardthat we now call the Ebola vaccine.I got Merck involved and I got the moneyfrom the Norwegian government that fundedthe ring vaccination trials.And then--The ring vaccination trials were stupid.What they were was vaccinating villages around an outbreakto see if they could make a ring of vaccinated peoplethat would stop the spread of Ebola.Do you hear how stupid that is?Do you hear how stupid that is now that we know what we know?Ebola vaccines in a ring applied to healthy peoplearound the outbreak that he got fundingfrom the Norwegian government for that?As a-- what is he, a farmer?I've also been right at the forefrontof drug repurposing for first Perzika.There's a number of papers relating to Perzika.And Zika Pathogenesis and Drug Repurposingstarted a company that went bankrupt.I've done, I think, four different startups in my lifeand because there was no funding for drug repurposing.And then since the beginning of this outbreak,I got a call from a member of the intelligence communitythat was in Wuhan that I've published with in the past,was in Wuhan during the fourth quarter of 2019.And he called me on January 4th of 2020and told me that I need to get my team spun upbecause of this new pathogen.So we started working on--The funny thing is there might not be anything like Ebola,but there is a patent out there by Sina Bavarifor elongated vaccine--sorry, elongated viral-like particlesthat assemble a lot like what the Ebola virus looks like,which is this long rod-shaped structure.So Ebola virus might not exist, but viral-like particlesin the shape of Ebola might exist.And they might have been released and testedin remote places in Africa to see what they would do.And then called Ebola, and then peoplelike Steven Hatfield and Meryl Nass--and, well, no, Meryl Nass was not Ebola.She was anthrax.All of these stories have been controlled narrativesin order to put people in place as expertsand then keep them there in case they need them.I suspect that's what most of these people are.That's why there's a transcript of Meryl Nass and Vera Shoravand Robert Malone all talking about the anthrax vaccinein 2011, because this narrative and the skepticismin public health has needed control for many more yearsthan just the last four.And some of these people have involved in controllingthat narrative, even in closed circles of just autism momsfor the last 10 years.Because for a long time, autism moms and autism dadswere just relegated to the deepest corners of the internetwhere no one would listen to them.And that ended up being ICANN and CHD.And they thought that CHD and ICANN meant progress.But in the end, I think, because of saboteurswithin both of those organizations,essentially they don't accomplish everything they could.And they make these people that are donatingand people that are acting in good faith.They make them feel like that this is the best waythat they can move forward.But they are all collectively frustrated by whathappens at the top.I think that's very clear.And the ones that aren't frustratedjust don't understand that the questions that these peopleare asking aren't going to solve the problem thatis represented by the vaccine schedule.And I don't want to be critical, but I do want to be honest.If you keep arguing that you want randomized controltrials for vaccines, you're not arguing for the truth.If you keep arguing that you want health freedomand the freedom to tell the truth because free speechis important, then you're not really fighting for the truth.I mean, yes, you are, but no, you're not.Because the truth is that the vaccine scheduleis a criminal enterprise in the United States.And to not say that out loud knowing it is essentially lying.And I think that that's where we are.And this video with Robert Malone interactingin a seemingly respectful and reciprocally professional waywith Paul Cattrell, who has himself up there,you can see very clearly as Dr. Paul Cattrell.Robert Malone doesn't even call himself a doctorin his own caption here.So you see, that's a problem, right?I don't call myself Dr. Cooley.But Paul Cattrell has been calling himself Dr. PaulCattrell as long as he's been in front of his camerawith his four blank screens.And that should be a huge red flag,because he's not a doctor.And his PhD is in finance.And he worked for a Catholic charity before this,which is kind of bizarre, because Catholicsare one of the oldest and largest weaponized pilesof money that nobody talks about.And I'm a Catholic.I was raised Catholic, went to CCD, the whole thing.So I know what the Catholic Church faith is.I know what it's all about.I've read about its history.I've been up two minds for a long time about the ideathat my priest, for example, that I grew up with,I know is one of the best people I've ever met.And the reason why I'm a ham radio operatoris because of him.I used to go over to his house and listen to him talkto a guy in Japan.And it was just freaking awesome.Because the radio is like the coolest piece of equipmentI've ever seen and the way that he used it.And it just was cool.And so I had a relationship with a priest, Father Garum,a long time as a kid who made me believethat people of faith are some of the most beautiful and heartwarming and gentle people in the world.That was my model.I'm sure one of the best priests in the Catholic Churchin the early '80s.I tried to take his call sign, actually.But that turned out to be not possible when I registered.And I never really went back to it.But I still kind of wanted to catch his call signbecause it's not available again.But anyway, I don't remember why I got to that.Oh, because Paul Kintrall worked for a Catholic charity.It's just interesting.Computational screening and dockingof entire library of licensed drugs.A bit lower.Sorry about that.That eventually led to myself administering some of thosewhen I became infected with a biogen outbreakat the end of February 2020.And that led to the discovery of femoridine or Pepsid.So a biogen outbreak.And then he discovered femotidine and Pepsid.So I got to go back a little bit because Idon't know if he said domain server or what he said.Fourth of 2020.And told me that I need to get my team spun upbecause of this new pathogen.So we started working on computational screeningand docking of entire library of licensed drugs.And that eventually led to myself administering someof those when I became infected.So here he wasn't very specific about whatit was that he was looking at there docking to,which is already revealing to me.Because in other interviews, he said a little bit moreabout what they were docking to.At one point, he said that he made a computer model of an X-raycrystallography reconstruction of the 3L, 3CL protease.But he didn't say that here.So it changes over time.With the biogen outbreak at the end of February 2020.And that led to the discovery of femotidine.The biogen outbreak.It's like the super spreader event in Koreathat Kevin McCarron was infected by.It's the exact same bullshit story.Mr. Pepsid wrote the Northwell.It could not be a bullshit story.It could also be the release of a transfection at those placesso that those people would test positive or a release of a toxinso that those people would experiencesome respiratory systems or a combination of both.I don't know.But my guess is that it's part of the show.That's why Kevin McCarron also has a story like that.The whole contract for that, together with Jim Talton,Northwell screwed up those trials.But we've carried on.I've got multiple papers published or in pressinvolving femotidine and then the combination of femotidineand selcoxib.And the first of those papers wasuploaded in July of 2020.It's been through peer review three times.It's still not been published.It's been approved in peer review three times.Proved in peer review.And the poll by the editors of Frontiers at the last minute,just like Pierre Corey's figure was.But those are the trials that we finallyhave FDA clearance to proceed on.So I'm one of not very many peoplethat understand this whole spectrum of vaccines, pandemics,drug repurposing, pharmacology, and molecular virology.It sounds kind of like Jessica Rose,who's computational mathematics, computational biology,immunology, virology, and something else, right?So there's a new drug that is in clinical trials three,I believe.It's called-- I may be pronouncing it wrong,but the malnue pyro--You talking about the Merck product?Yeah.Yeah.It's originally called EIDD 2801.It was initially funded by the crewthat I work with at the Defense Reduction Agency.We tried to get--The crew that he works with at the Defense Reduction--Threat Reduction Agency, the DITRA--you know, DITRA, the one that was originallysupposed to clean up nuclear weapons using--in cooperation with the State Department?As part of the formulations, we were using a multi-drugapproach.And we wanted to include it as the antiviral in our combination.The other agents are anti-inflammatories.But Merck acquired it from Ridgeback.The same character that I was justreferring to that works for the three-letter agenciesused to report to the Assistant Secretary for Preparednessand Defense, Bob Cadillac.He helped broker the Merck deal.So he's pretty close to Bob Cadillac then, right?Because the guy who used to work for Bobbrokered a deal for him.So if he says that Bob Cadillac's a real bad guy,it would be very interesting, right?Because he's-- you know, he works with DITRA and--and he's-- he's not a whistleblower, ladies and gentlemen,because he didn't lose his job with DITRA for speaking out.He didn't lose his consulting with Merck for speaking out.This August, 2021, he's still talking shit,can still remember the original names of these compoundsbefore they came up with something like mole pulvinir.So yeah, EIDD 2801, there are--so the name, it has to do with the Emory Drug Discovery Groupand Ray Shinazi is a famous member of that.So that's the origin of the original acronym.And there are others at Emory that feelthat this is a highly inappropriate compoundto be advancing because of potential reproductive toxicologyissues that they're concerned about.We'll see how that bears.There's also-- so this is-- this is one of the new hopesfor a direct acting antiviral.The other one is the Pfizer 3Cl Proyace inhibitor.So when Tony Fauci did his great pivot two weeks agoand suddenly started talking about, well, we need drugsthat we can administer early and turn COVIDinto something like the common cold,he was only really thinking about these two agents.And he had us no enthusiasm for repurposed drug.At the DOD, fortunately, we're entirely separatefrom Dr. Fauci's control.What's that?At the DOD, we're completely separate.Did he just say that?These two agents and he had us no enthusiasmfor repurposed drug.At the DOD, fortunately, we're entirely separatefrom Dr. Fauci's control and oversight.And so we're able to pursue the science that we seeas most appropriate.And we've been focusing on drug repurposing, as I said,from the beginning of 2020.And we actually-- in the trials, wehad designed a three-armed outpatient trial thatwould be placebo versus selocoxyde and plamodidineversus selocoxyde plamodidine and nivromectin.But the FDA created such a storm with their objectionsto including nivromectin.They put clauses in there that were so intonable.It would have taken us six months to a yearto satisfy them.So we just dropped the nivromectin arm.But the data suggests that the triple combination is reallypotent.And surprisingly, the addition of--so we've been very laboratory focused in terms of--so the plamodidine and selocoxyde combination,even in certainly outpatients, but in inpatients,we can see a point of inflectionin a lot of the key labs that are predictedabout kinds of COVID when we started administering drug.It's quite striking.We now can manage COVID using classical laboratory assaysand make decisions about clinical management.One of the things that was intriguing about the addition--those with ivermectin is that we saw much more rapid improvementin the leukocyte fraction in the CBC counts.And it appears that there is some benefit in termsof lymphocyte recovery.But then there's the recent data out of Israelthat I had thought was not going to be forthcoming.There's long speculation that ivermectin might have some directacting antiviral activity.And the new Israeli double-blank randomized clinical trial,with only 55, I think, is right,150 or 60 patients, hit statistical significanceand demonstrated that there is an antiviral componentto the ivermectin activity.So ivermectin is an antiviral becauseof statistical significance, a p-value thatis measured against a null hypothesis, whichis we would see no difference between the groupsunless ivermectin did something.So we'll be testing for modulating in cellcoxswain because that's what we could get through the FDA.And that took us three months in negotiation.But I suspect that in the end, peoplewill find that the triple might be even more useful there.But I addressed that spectrum of pharmaceuticals.And so you saw that fluboxamine data came in positive today.That's more news.Something like 38%, 35% protection.35% to 38% protection is absolutely--That right there tells you that he's a liar.You don't need to hear anything elsebecause there is no questioning the novelty of the virus.There is only reinforcing the novelty,reinforcing the new cause of death,the risk additive pathogen that has been added to the mix.He is absolutely positively reinforcingthe worst case scenario.He's lying about it because he's telling my friend Nathanthat there's reason for a guy at DITRAto be working on repurposed drugs.That there's a reason that's malevolence,that they're not telling people that these drugs work.He says that he can treat COVID with standard laboratoryprocedures and repurposed drugs now.And they're lying about it.And who's he saying it to?The absolute biggest fraud of them all.And we're supposed to believe he's unaware.We're supposed to believe that Robert Malone, who works for DITRA,didn't check either of these two clownsbefore he went on the podcast.It was easier to be naive in 2021when we were all afraid and scared, ladies and gentlemen.There's no excuse for being naive now, not when it's so obvious.Listen to the next part.RCTs, ivermectin, in that same trial, did not show efficacy.But they administered the ivermectin lateand at relatively low doses.So a case could be made that that one was set up to failfor the ivermectin arm.But the fluvoxamine definitely getsstatistical significance.So we now need to add--It hits statistical significance.What did he say? 35% to 37% protection?Wow.Stop lying.Fluvoxamine is another agent that--we already knew that.I don't know how attuned you have beeninto the fluvoxamine story.But I'm in touch with Steve Kirsch almost hourly.He's the one that funded the George Washington studiesat GWU.I'm in touch with Steve Kirsch almost hourly.Stop lying.Stop lying together, please.That's how we got here.People lying together in concert.This is a difference.So this is now the fourth study about fluvoxamine.That's great.That's great.See, the watchers need to realizethat there is more tools in the toolboxas researchers like yourself are investigating compoundsto try to fight the disease, COVID-19,or the virus, SARS-CoV-2.And that's where the virus is necessarily the vaccine.And the way Fauci has been spinning it,it was Moderna, Moderna, Moderna, Moderna.From the kick-hole.Oh, you know what?Moderna.That's the vaccine, right?That can be true for the vaccine.And Moderna was created by DARFA.So there's-- yeah, there's all kinds of angles herethat I prefer not to go into havingto do with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundationand the tight relationships there and their lobbying.And you know, Zuckerberg Chan and Robert Wood Johnson and WHOand Facebook.And there's just a huge array of folksthat are with money and power.So he hasn't said anything about a denovirus being shit.And he hasn't said anything about transfection being shit.He hasn't told anybody anything about the dangers thatare to come, neither has the bus rider MD Paul Cottrell.We are quite a few minutes into this little podcast.10 minutes already in.And I don't feel any danger.I just feel the narrative of a novel virusthat people don't understand and are lying about.That have gone all in on vaccines as the only solution.And I'm a vaccinologist.But my assessment from the outset wasthat the risk of antibody dependent enhancementbased on prior work with coronavirus vaccine developmentwas so great that--and the timelines to demonstrate a safe and effective vaccinewere so long.And the risk that this was going to hit the states.Remember, I started in the beginning of January.I was--[MUSIC PLAYING]We have to go back because this is another extremelyincriminating statement.Why is it incriminating?Because he's telling you a story, a story about antibodydependent enhancement, which is a story where vaccination works.Antibody dependent enhancement is a story where vaccinationworks just not as we expected or it doesn't work out perfect.It occasionally goes wrong.That's what the story of antibody dependent enhancement is.Antibody dependent enhancement is probably bullshit.If it's real, it is a very small subset of whatoccurs when vaccination goes wrong.And the subsequent exposure to the same pathogencauses a devastating disease state.That's-- it's not just antibody dependent enhancement.If it is, then I'm wrong.But I have a feeling that antibody dependent enhancementis a pretty convenient story that still keeps antibodiesat the center at the primary model of immunity, whichis, again, his job.And that means that unlike the storythat he told Jay Bhattacharya on the illusion of consensuspodcast this year, that he lost his careerbecause he spoke out against Jesse Gelsinger and the useof AAV on a healthy kid that needed a gene replaced in hisliver, had blowing the whistle on them going off of the protocoland increasing his dose, was what cost him his career,that he had to get out of gene transfection technologyand instead had to resort to, I don't know,starting a breast cancer firm--breast cancer laboratory in Maryland.That was what resulted from him losing his career speaking outon behalf of Jesse Gelsinger kind of.And so here he is now saying that I thought the AAV or the RNAmight cause antibody dependent enhancement.That's why I spoke out, which is exactly notsaying that intramuscular injection of any combinationof substances with the intent of augmenting the immune systemis dumb.It's not saying that transfection and transformationin healthy humans is criminally negligent.And it's not saying that RNA can't pandemic.It's in reinforcing all the opposites of those thingsthat we have defeated things in the past with vaccines.And these vaccines may or may not work,but there are other ways we could deal with it, right, Paul?So I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.And I think that's why I'm talking about the vaccine.Just let me write that down.The papain-like protease.I think it's possible that he said in other interviewsthat he worked on X-ray crystallography of the three--of the three CL protease, and theninterfaced all of known drugs and pharmaceuticalsin the FDA catalog against that computer model.And if I find that, and I can play him saying those wordsout loud, then that would be really strange, right?Because he says in this interview,wouldn't that be crazy, Robert?Hey, Robert Malone, if you're watching,wouldn't it be crazy if you did an interview a yearafter this, where you said that you used X-ray crystallographymodels in a computer to model the three-dimensional formof the three CL protease, and theninterface that with all the FDA drugs and pharmaceuticals?Because here, when talking to the fake Dr. Paul Cottrell,you say you didn't bother to do the three CL protease.You did the papain-like protease.Boy, it would be terrible if I founda video where you said the opposite.Wouldn't that be weird?For the seafood market, Wuhan's seafood market virussequence was first uploaded.I didn't focus on three CL pro, whichis what the Pfizer drug is inhibiting.It's protease inhibitor.Rather, I focused on the papain-like protease,because I knew that there was already a lot of candidatesthat are out there, and a lot of attention on three CL pro.And the Pfizer is one of many thatare candidates for inhibitors, or three CL pro.These are both serine proteases.And serine proteases inhibitors are notoriouslynon-specific in the pharmaceutical industry,and prone to dose-limiting toxicity and complications.So time will tell how that plays out,and I wish them the best.But with my group of pharmaceutical experts,we've always been very wary of the potential risks associatedwith focusing on the serine protease.So the cocktail that you've been investigating,is that with or without the core costeroids?Or individual?So matter of fact, we've got strong datathat if you add dexamethasone, you kill people.No, I'm not kidding you.You can laugh.The paper is out there.We just had it provisioned.Wait, so Paul Cottrell just laughed?Dexamethasone kills people?What if dexamethasone is on protocols, like the FLCCprotocol?What if dexamethasone was on CDC protocols?What if the misuse of steroids was on my slidefor the last three years?And the misuse of steroids can do what?It can kill people?Explain that, Robert.I actually accepted.I just got to make a couple of modificationsabout how many people in the study group were smokers, whichno effect is at risk, and not always in a negative way.So they were not active smokers.They were recovered smokers.And that actually, because of the groups they were in,it actually makes our conclusions even stronger.But if your readers, or if you want to post a link,I can send you the--we put everything up on pre-print service right away,because of the nature of the emergency.And so the Fremontadine plus Celecoxib with and withoutdexamethasone--Because of the nature of the emergency,he didn't bother to tell you thattransfection and transformation in healthy humansis criminally negligent.He didn't tell you that they startedmanufacturing these things, because they've alwaysbeen planning to change the warm base of manufacturingfrom stuff done in eggs to stuff done with nucleotides.Even though he admitted that on the podcast,I was on with him with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Merrill Nass.But he could have said it right now in 2021, right hereto Paul Cottrell, and just told him, just like he did earlierin this interview where he said before 9/11,nobody was making nucleotides at large scale.Nobody was doing that kind of manufacturing.And he helped all those people develop that manufacturingafter 9/11, which is a curious thing to say,because Marcus said that 9/11 was supposedto be a bioterror attack, but for some reason it wasn't.And he still can't really figure out why.So it's curious that he just drops that data point,because around 9/11 was when he was in Maryland workingon this breast cancer institute.So it's weird while he was working on this breast cancerinstitute with a couple of Nigeriansthat he and his wife were also apparently workingon setting up this manufacturing of nucleotides allaround the United States with all these different players.It's all one continuous operation, one continuous story.And they told you that something significant happenedat the beginning of 2020 with peoplelike him who were involved before the event occurred.And therefore, are very well awarethat they need to see the narrative in 2020 and 2021of a novel virus.And when he came out in 2021, he was still fully on boardwith the perpetuation of the ideathat a novel RNA molecule starting from a mud puddlein a market has gone around the worldand continues to go around the worldand can be mitigated by the things that he and his teamthat he spun up found, as well as potentially transformationand transfection, of which he is the foremost expert,because him and his wife are the holder of all the relevantpatents from years ago.And he would still be doing it had he notspoke out against Jesse Gelsinger's going off protocolwhen then he had to resort to opening a breast cancerinstitute and get out of this forever,at least for a little while, because he was, of course,head of a novio, which is one of the horses in the racein this time.And he even says a novio is one of the people making,or one of the firms making vaccines.So it's an extraordinary level of contradictionthat's available to anyone who wants to see it now.It might have been available even when it first came out,but we were too confused and too afraid,and we were still playing along with the Scooby-Doo,so we definitely couldn't see him for the charlatan that he is.But in 2024, if you can't see him for the charlatanthat he is, just because he spent hours with Dr. PaulCottrell, then I challenge you to listen to his wordsthat he says to Paul Cottrell and not see him as a fraud,because it's almost impossible.Some paper is readily available on a preprint server,and it clearly shows we jumped from 0% case fatality rate.He definitely emphasizes different thingsat different times, because they've been off scriptfor a long time.It may be that Robert Malone wasn't even supposed to gopublic.They didn't even expect to need to,because they expected 85% or 95% of the peopleto take the shot, and they didn't.And so this is 2021, where they're still thinkingthat maybe they can get the rest of the people to complyby the end of the year.That's what this guy's all about.Maybe they can get the rest of the people in the worldto think that a novel virus is still circulating,and that if they go on a White House briefing rightbefore Christmas and tell everybodythat there's going to be a winter of severe diseaseand death, that people will take it seriously,because that's going to happen after this.And that's why it seems like he flip-flops or tellsthe story in different ways, because it's improvising.They're off script.They thought they would get a lot more compliancewith the illusion of consensus on TVthat they projected in 2020, and they didn't.- In hospitalized COVID, WHO, you know,forced six to something like 23 or 25% mortality,and the president's dexamethasone.We then verified that it's not generally understoodby most docs, but the data supporting dexis really quite tenuous.It took a lot of statistical manipulationto show statistical significance.It's in a very small cohort that does reachstatistical significance.- He says it should not be--- Here's the perfect example of the charlatanism,because here he's saying that they didsome kind of significance testing,and that's not enough, or they did it disingenuously,but his result of 35% to 38% effectivenessisn't that same shit.And that's how you get these Academy magicians.That's how they work.They do it right.It's the other people who do it wrong.I use p-values the right way.They use p-values disingenuously.And so we're supposed to believe that,although he's a 20-year insider,he wouldn't use p-values that way to make money.No, even though he's from the industry,even though he's broker deals for these thingsthat people use p-values to create value out of,he would never do that.It is just laughable how ridiculous this guy isto be taken seriously enough to be on Tucker Carlson.And that should have undermined his credibility,but it somehow doesn't.Him being on Alex Jones a week agodoesn't undermine this credibility,or Alex Jones is apparently.How stupid are we?We gotta wake up and apologizefor having followed these people for so long.I know I'm apologizing to everybodythat needs my apology regularly,and I have a permanent link on my websitethat is self-deprecating enough to say thatI was wrong in 2020 and '21.And even if I was very close to right,people like Robert Malone and Kevin McCarronand Charles Rixie and Richard Flemingand Richard E. Bright and all of these peoplethat talk, talk, talk, talk, talk in my earand in everybody else's ear,made us think that there was a Scooby-Doo mystery to solve.And so we didn't get across the finish linequick enough to save any college kid.We didn't get across the finish linequick enough to save any adult that we lovefrom making the mistake.And you can hear Robert Malone's language.His language is not effectively going to stop anybodyfrom transfection or transformation at all.And if he's the expert he says he was,and he's standing up the way he says he was,then that should be his only message.He shouldn't be trying to bamboozle everybodywith stupid, complicated explanations about a Merc productor that Merc product or that Merc productor that thing I did or that incorporated productthat I did or that company that I work for.I brokered that thing.It would be just really simple.I know a lot about transformation and transfectionbecause I hold all the relevant patentsalthough they're expired and I moved my careeron to other things because that shit ain't goodfor humans yet.But he doesn't say that.He never said it on Brett.He doesn't say it here.He still really isn't saying it now.And neither is Kevin McKernan.He didn't need it.He shouldn't have taken it.And once you see that Kevin McKernan and Robert Maloneare very likely running in exactly the same circleswith exactly the same weaponized piles of moneyinfluencing them and that Paul Cottrelljust wants to be a part of it.It's pretty easy.And who's the only guy that he promoted so farin this interview?Pierre Corey, the hero of the Ivermectin book.The guy who says that pole sock simitorswere the primary way of identifying COVID in New York Cityeven though he didn't show up until after the big death wavewas already over.And yet somehow or another he's the headwas the head of FLCCC for a $230,000 salary for a year or two.He's the one who got the Ivermectin book deal.And he's the one despite all being all therein the first part of the pandemicdoesn't seem to realize that we might've killed peoplewith protocols like Dexamethasone.Isn't that what Robert Malone is saying right herethat he knows that they were killing peoplewith Dexamethasone which would have created the illusionof an advancing deadly virus but they didn't what?He used this widely as it's being usedif you were gonna go fully evidence based.And there's overlap in terms of the mechanismof action with cell toxic.When you add the two, they're definitely more toxicand lethal and this was verified in a platform trialcalled I Spy that hasn't been published yetthat we also funded through DOD.We had counseled that they should not.- So we is Dittra.I'm assuming we is Dittra because he says his team was Dittraand it's DOD.So one of the things that the secret thingsthat I think he's doing here now in four yearsin retrospect is that he's connecting in the mindsof the people that are listening, Dittra to the DOD.But the real connection Dittra should haveis to a bunch of shit including the State Departmentand the Executive Branch.They are not really DOD like DARPA's DOD.They're not really DOD like DOD is DOD.They may partner with DOD, maybe even his team partnerswith some people in the Department of Defense.But Dittra is an organization connected to a lotof other intelligence agencies and originally formedhas a partnership between the State Departmentand the DOD, correct me if I'm wrong in the chat.So it's very curious to me that he is interchangingDittra and DOD in this talk.I think it's on purpose to obfuscate the factthat Dittra has also deep long ties to the State Departmentwhich I think is central in terms of conductingthis operation.It's the one intelligence agencythat all these monkeys don't talk about.They love to say NSA and CIS, CIA and FBI and HHS and DODbut they never say State Departmenteven though they're the only peoplethat are in every country.They're the only people that can movein and out of countries easily and seamlessly.And they're the only way that the DODor any other authorities can move seamlesslyfrom country to country, just through the State Department.Charles Rixie's uncle or something like thatused to work at the State Department.The State Department sells weapons for the United States.Robert Malone's been to Romania three times in two yearsor two times in one year or something like that.Because that's where the resistance is.- Proceed with the trial armed in the presence of DEXbut they insisted that they do sobecause they considered it standard of carein their basically a WHO 5.6 cohort.So this is under high flow oxygen or intubation.And so that is where DEX is indicated.They insisted that we had to have DEX on boardand they wanted to go ahead with the trialand in fact they verified that the trends were suchthat we would be, I don't know how to say this delicately,more patients would be lost on the triple culmination.Their study also has a standard of care remdesivir.And I suspect that your viewership may be awarethat remdesivir's efficacy is not quitewhat we really led to believe.And most would say that it doesn't supportthe license that it has right now, the authorization.In any case, that's a tangent that's going down the rabbit hole.But yeah, stay away from the steroidsthat we're gonna use for monitoring cell toxic.And it's a good thing and you'll see in a paper,you've got a lengthy discussion in that onein which I extensively quote Tony Faucifor an interesting review paper we did on DEX a few years ago.DEX is like a great big hammer to the immune system.- Okay, I'm gonna read this.- Absolutely not.A case can be made that DEX is a great drugif you've got hospitalized COVIDand you wanna pump your numbers upby getting them out the door and transferring themto a extended care facility,instead of having them dying in your hospitalto be a little bit jaded.But in fact, that's what goes on.- Okay, so there he just admitted it right therethat they're murdering people and lying about it.Listen again very clearly,because I want you to see how he's smiling.He's laughing about the idea that adding DEX a methazonecould create the illusion that they cured peopleand they could send people with bacterial pneumoniaback to care homes and out of a hospital.And so they were encouraging peopleto give them DEX a methazone to reduce their immune,to reduce their symptoms so that they could clear beds.And that these people probably had bacterial pneumonia.They get sent to a care homewhere they don't get antibiotics and they die of COVID.And he's laughing about it,because he doesn't want anybody,there's no reason to think that they would kill peopleand then lie about it in order to create the illusionof a pandemic.But he pretty much already knowsthat they're killing people.Tony Fauci for an interesting review paperhe did on DEX a few years ago.DEX is like a great big hammer to the immune system.And absolutely not, a case can be made that DEXis a great drug.If you've got hospitalized COVIDand you want to pump your numbers upby getting them out the door and transferring themto a extended care facility,instead of having them die in your hospitalto be a little bit jaded.But in fact, that's what goes on.- Oh, is that what goes on?- This is just the tip of the icebergof how malevolent this lying machine is.This is just the tip of the icebergof how malevolent this show was.If the math isn't working out for you now,I don't know how to help,but I'm gonna keep trying every day.Robert Malone is one of the largest fraudsthat has ever been perpetrated on the United States.And anybody that's connected to himis obviously also part of this illusionand working for them, the slavers as I call them.This is a shameless traitor to the United States,posing as a conservative American,but actually a long, lifelong democratic operative,as he says as his wife, has his Steve Kirsch,one of the largest single donors to the DNC.These people are pathetic,and they are lying to usso that we will lie to our kids about this stuff.And if we don't wake up in the next few monthsby a significant number of peopleto fully reject people like this,we may not ever escape.Clearly this election is screwed.Clearly, no matter who gets elected in this election,we are still going to be fighting this fraud.And so this is just the start of the fight,ladies and gentlemen.The Uniparty needs to be destroyed.That dichotomy that Robert Malone and Steve Kirschand all these people are trying to enforceneeds to be destroyed.And we need to elect some plumbersand some teachers and some carpentersand some entrepreneurs and some social workersand some people that have actually lived in realityand sacrificed their adulthood for the sake of othersto office in the United States.We need to open the books.We need to put cameras in the roomswhere these people talk in private.We need to publish their discussionsand take the cameras off the streetsand put them into our Congressand into our House of Representatives.People like Robert Malone who have been brokeringthese multi-million and multi-billion dollar dealsfor pharmaceutical products that are proven to workonly by the ritual of statistical mindlessnessneed to be ended as relevant.He is and a perfect example of a catamagiciansand how they work just like what Garrett is talking about.- Two fighting games agreed on one thing.It was scientific inference cannot be mechanical.You need to use your brain.And that was exactly the message the non-ritchalsdid not convey.Maybe it wanted a mechanical procedure.- So that's what he's telling youis the reason why some of his drug recombination,these recombinant drug,these repurposed combinations of drugsreach significance, it's not his fault.It's just the way it is.Either it's not or it isand it looks like statistically it is.So therefore we have knowledge.Robert Malone is an a catamagicianbut not an a catamagician that's just naive.He works for people who he knows regularlyand he's not a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a

catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He's a catamagician.He asks, "Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Kattrell and Robert Malonebeing on the same podcast more than once, talking for hoursabout the bullshit that you just heard them talking about,and more than 70 minutes more, is the most damning evidencethat Robert Malone is on the team of the slaversthan anything I've ever seen."Never mind that the contents of that interviewcontradict the contents of interviews that come after.That his story changes, that his emphasis changes.Robert Malone is awful.And anybody that says that their substack,defending Robert Malone in 2023, is the most importantsubstack they've ever written, is just as awful as him.And yes, I'm talking about Meryl Nass,because she wrote a substack sayingthat this was the most important substack she ever wroteand was defending Robert Malone.And then a month later, Robert Malone came out and saidthat CHD was a shitty organizationand evidence of how shitty a manager, Robert F. KennedyJr., is, despite the fact that that shitty organizationpublished his shitty book.Right?I can't wait until I see Robert Malone in person again,so I can watch him get on all fours,the tail fall out of his pants, and him scramble awaylike the giant rat that he is.Measure the quality of an article.Now, what did the poor readers of these textbooks do?With a mishmash of two theories, which was not mentioned that.It is mishmash, not in the names of naming and peers,and attached to the theories.So the result was that the external conflict between the twogroups of statisticians, the decisionwent into an internal conflict in the average researcher.So the average-- I use a Freudian analogy to make that clear.So the super ego was Nyman-Piersen theory.So the average researcher somehowbelieved that he or she had to have two hypothesesand actually give thought about alpha and the powerbefore they experiment and calculate the numberof subjects you need.But the ego, the Fisher in part, got the things doneand published, but left with a feeling of guiltof having violated the rules.And at the bottom was the Bayesian id,longing for probabilities of hypothesis,which Nisa of these two theories could deliver.How did all this come apart?So how could this happen?I'll give you another story.I once visited a distinguished statistical textbook writerwhose book went through many editionsand whose name doesn't matter.He was one of the only ones--actually, his book was one of the bestone in the social sciences.And he was the only one who had in an early editiona chapter on Bayes and also, albeit only one sentence,mentioning that there is a theory of Fisherand a different one of Pearson, name and Pearson.So to mention the existence of alternative theorieswas unheard of and even names attached to that.So I asked him why he took out the chapter on Bayesand this one sentence from all further editions.When I met him, he was just busy having, I think,was the fifth edition of his best-selling book.And why he, I asked him, created an inconsistent hybridthat every decent statistician would have rejected.To his credit, I should say that he also did not attemptto deny that he had produced an illusion.But he let me know whom to blame for.And there were three culprits.First, his fellow researchers, thenthe university administration, and third, his publisher.His fellow researchers, he said, are not interestedin doing good statistics.They want their papers published.The university administration promoted peopleby the number of publications, whichwere enforced, the researchers' attitude.And his publisher did not want to hear about different theories.He wanted a single recipe cookbook and forced him,so the author told me, to take out the Bayesian chapterand even this single only one sentence about Fisher and Neymanand Pearson theories.At the end of our conversation, I asked him,in what statistical theory he himself believes.And he said, he in my heart, I'm a Bayesian.Now, if the author was telling me the truth,he had sold his heart for multiple editionsof a famous book whose message he did not believe in.10,000 students have read this text,believing that it reveals the method of science.Dozens of less informed textbook writerscopied his text, turning out a flood of offspring textbooksinconsistent and not noticing the message.Now, you understand, right?You understand, right, what this meansand what Gert is trying to tell youis that these ideas of how to use probabilitywithout your mind--in other words, you have a null hypothesisand then one you think you're testing,but then the experiment doesn't test that,because the null hypothesis is kind of like there's no difference.So that's not really--it's not explaining anything.And your test of whether the null hypothesis is differentfrom your hypothesis actually doesn'ttest your hypothesis at all.And so the argument that was bled togetherfrom these two separate kind of ideason how to use statistics to test observationswere put together to create this illusionthat you could mindlessly use statisticsto find observations that were significant.This was actually sustained in textbooks.Imagine the malevolence that needs to be presentin order for our entire academiato have been turned upside down by people who understand itand choose not to teach it.And so you have this huge behemoth of moneythat's being fed to universitiesand then they are employing it to create this noise,create this knowledge.And they are using a fundamentally flawed procedurebecause they've all agreed that it's--it's-- it-- it--they know how to use it.And Robert Malone, as he showed very definitivelyin that interview, knows that this can be gained,it can be used, it can be lied to, you can p-hack.But he doesn't do it.Yet in that same little discussion,he tells you that a 35% to 38% differencebetween placebo and the experimental groupis a significant resultbecause he doesn't p-hack, they p-hack.And the reality is, is that everybodythat uses these p-values and a null hypothesis,the null hypothesis for Robert Malone,well, there's no difference between us giving themthese three drugs and not giving them these three drugs.And if there is a difference, then the difference we seeis because of these three drugs.And since we assume our hypothesis is,is that these drugs work on COVIDand we're not going to test whether they actually have COVIDor whether it's real COVID or what COVID is,we're just going to look at a differencebetween these two groups.And because over here, way outside of the wordingof the paper, there's this hypothesisthat we're not testing that these drugs work on COVID.Then when we get a significant resultthat there is a difference between these two groups,we assume we've tested this hypothesis over herewhen really all we've asked is whether or notthere's a difference between people that get these drugsand people that don't get these drugs.Is it surprising that if you give people a combinationof three drugs that they have different behavioraland symptom different symptomologiesthan people who don't get those drugs,is that not surprising?Is that surprising to you?And that's how they do it.That's why I didn't make it in academic biologybecause I couldn't figure out how to make this work for meand feel good about it.And I didn't understand that it was a cognitive dissonancethat was preventing me from doing it.I just thought that I wasn't very good at it.And that's more importantly,what a lot of those people made me feel like,that I wasn't very good at it.But I was more frustrated with the questions we're askingdon't really feel like they're moving the ball forward.I want to ask different questions.No, no, no.We got to ask little questions that have little answersso we can make a little progresstoward addressing that hypothesis in the other room.That's how this works.We have to have a firm ritual for this procedurefor the essence of the hybrid logicbecause it resembles two social rights.Social rights have typically the following elements.They are sacred numbers or colors.Then there's a repetition of the same action again and again.And then there's fear.Fear about being punished if you don't repeat this action.And finally, delusions.You have to have delusions in order to conduct the ritual.The null ritual contains all of these features.There's a fixation on 5%.And in functional MRI, it's colors.Second, functional MRI.My gosh, if that hasn't ruined cognitive neuroscience,I don't know what has.This idea that if they just take a magnetic pictureof the oxygenated and unoxygenated hemoglobin in your brain,they can pinpoint where certain activity in the brain isand therefore they can learn whether certain partsof the brain are involved in anything.And the crazy thing is,depending on how they set the color schemeand depending on what they say is significance,then they can find pretty much whatever they want to.And indeed, MRI, the field itselfhas just become a giant toilet bowl of nulls.And that's a great way to stabilize them,get out the door.And that is one way that it's usedin some hospital environments.- That's very interesting.So let's pivot to the antibody dependent enhancementand vaccine.- Oh, sorry, I pushed the wrong video again, this one.There's repetitive behaviorresembling compulsive hand washing.And third, there's fear of sanctions by editors or advisors.And finally, there's a delusionabout what a p-value means.And I will describe that in a moment.Let me just give you a few examplesabout the mindless performance of the ritual.There may be funny, but deep, it's really disconcerting.So in an internet study on implicit theoriesof moral courage, Philip Zimbardo,who's famous for his Stainford prison experimentsand two colleagues, asked their participants,do you feel that there's a differencebetween altruism and heroism?Most felt so, 2347 respondents said yes,and only 58 said no.Now the authors computed a chi-square testto answer whether these two numbers are the same or different.And I found that they are indeed different.A great student of mine, a smart one,had the opposite situation.His name is Pogo.Pogo ran an experiment with two groupsand found that the two means are exactly the same.But Pogo could not just write that or say that.He felt he had to do a statistical test,a t-test to find out whether the twoexactly same numbers differ significantly,and he found out they don't.And the P value was impressively high.Here's a third illustration.I recently reviewed an articlein which the number of subjects was 57.The authors calculated a 95% confidence interval.These are great too.For the number of subjects and concluded,the confidence interval is between 47 and 67.Don't ask why they did it.It's mindless.Almost every number in this paper was scrutinizedin the same way.The only numbers in the paper that had no confidencewere the page numbers.This is an extreme case,but unfortunately it's not the exception.Consider all behavioral, neuropsychological,and medical studies in nature in the year 2011.89% of these studies report only P value.And nothing else that's of importance,such as no effect sizes, no power, no model estimation.Or an analysis of the Academy of Management Journalin a year later reported that the average numberof P values in an article is,guess how many P values?If you have two hypotheses, you wouldn't need two.No.99.That's awesome.It's a mechanical testing of any number.So the idol of automatic universal inference,however, is not unique to P valuesor confidence intervals.Dennis Lindley, a leading advocate of Bayesian statistics,once declared that the only good statisticis Bayesian statistics,and that Bayesian methods are even more automatic,in his opinion, than Fisher's friend methods.So the danger is here, you don't have much progressif you use Bayes factors just as mindlessly.Awesome.So let me go on.An extremely important point that can be illustratedin neuroscience, because neuroscience is one of the placeswhere Bayesian statistics kind of took off firstand people started to use.And again, if you make a dumb modeland then you make dumb predictions with that modeland then test it with Bayesian statisticsor any other statistics,you're still working on a dumb model.So that happens a lot in neuroscience.And I actually got a lot of flackfor one of the last bike rides I rodebecause I did a pretty detailed talkabout how they had this experimental dataand then they made an experimental model.It was so simple and so dumb that using that modelto make some statistical estimate of whether or notit had anything to do with their experimental datawas just kind of dumbbecause we know the brain isn't that simple.So why would you even test if your model recapitulates that?We don't believe the brain works like your model.So why would you test it?And that's why he calls it mindless statisticsbecause editors of journals and reviewers of journalslike it when you do a statistical testand tell them that a number is significant,even if it has nothing to do with testing the hypothesisthat they think you're testing.- Examples about mindless use sound funny,but there are deep costs of the ritual.I'll give you a few examples.Maybe the first and quite interesting oneis that you actually fear betterif you don't specify your own hypothesis.- Bingo.- Why?Paul Meal once pointed out a methodologically paradox.- Here's a disease.- Sorry, here's where I really wanna make a pointthat's coming to my mind now and I wanna make it again.I had made the point earlier that if you're callingthe police on a crime,then you don't have to tell peoplewhat the motivation of the criminal is.You just have to call and say you need help.I'm gonna give you another example of that kind of scenariowhere we are being baited into providing an answerthat we're not obligated to provide.And because we don't wanna provide that answer,we are being told that that meansthat our objections are irrelevant.And so if I say that I don't think virology is a fieldlike virology would like you to believe it is,then I'm being asked,so then what is your explanation for this stuff?And I think that that is part of their own trap.That's the reason why Kevin McKernan was so interestedin trying to bait me into explaining in more detailwhat I thought was going on.Because then I would get into a hamster wheelof explanation and of hypothesesthat would never actually be tested.And then I would be playing the same bullshit game as them.When in reality, if I tell you that string theoryin physics as far as I'm concerneddoesn't really make any sense.And I think these people are just playingmathematical games with you.I don't really need to be sophisticated enoughto give you an alternative explanation for quantum theory.I just have to point out that lots and lots of other peoplethat are much more savvy than I am,have also said that string theoryis just a gigantic mathematical bullshit story.And they can't be tested.It hasn't been tested and the P values around itare not testing it.So I don't have to come up with an alternativefor a bullshit theory any more than I have to come upwith an alternative for a bullshit theoryfor RNA virology.And I certainly don't think that now I am underminingmy credibility by not explaining disease,whereas the no virus people have explained disease.So obviously the no virus people are much more,have much more integrity than Jonathan Cooey.Please understand that that is the most obvious ployof bullshit ever.We are not under any obligation to replace virologywith high fidelity understandingbefore anybody should take us seriously.And we are not under any obligationto explain respiratory disease or any other diseases.If we say that coronavirus and the pandemic was a lie.And that is what a lot of these meddlers would like us to do.They want us to spend our time waxing intellectualabout what virology is or what exosomes areor whatever these other things are.All we gotta know is that this ritualof mindless statistics has been used to create whole fields,has been used to create whole subfieldsof what the people inside and out of them think are knowledgebut are actually just nonsensebased on a mindless ritual of applying P values to numbers.And then if the P values are right,those numbers are significant observations.And without the mind, without a clever scientist,with a real idea and a real model of realitythat he or she is testing,mindless statistical rituals can be used to create PhDs,or use to create research lines,use to get nature articles, use to get tenure.And these people don't ever need to create knowledgetheir entire career.And this guy can teach you how.Measurement and amount of data make it harderfor a theory to pass because it can more easierdistinguish between the prediction of the theoryand the actual data.In fields that rely on the null ritual, it's the opposite.So because it tests a null in which you don't believe.So improvements of measurement.- What does he mean by that?- Yep.- What does he mean by that?Robert Malone was working under the hypothesisthat silicoxib and combination with Fumotidinewould have some effect on COVID, the disease.So his null hypothesis is that they don't have any effecton the disease.And that is actually what he tests when he does a P value.He's not testing whether it has any effect on the disease.He's testing whether it doesn't have any effecton the disease.And if he gets a significant result,then he has disproven that it doesn't have any effect.And the default then is to assume that the effectis due to the drugs.And if you can see how that's absolutely not testingwhether or not it helps people on COVID,but it's testing whether it doesn't.And if you're testing whether it doesn't,and you're basing that on a statistical differencebetween two groups,you're not actually testing anything you believe in.Because Robert Malone believes that these drugs,because of the domain work he's done,will help with COVID, COVID.And so if you're inside of a construct of a pandemicthat you know is a biosecurity state operation and a lie,then think about how as extraordinary it is,how confident he is that he can sustain that lieby telling you that he went through this mindlessritual statistics and produced knowledge.Now do you see why there is no doubt,it can be no doubt in anyone's mindthat Robert Malone is 100% playing for them?Because he is using the mindless statistical ritualof testing a null hypothesis to demonstrate to youthat there is a 35 to 37% effectivenessof the bullshit combinations that he's testingon behalf of Dittra and DoD.And he told that to someone as fraudulent as Paul Cottrellin August of 2021,after he had been on the Brett W. Angstein's podcastwith Steve Kirsch a month earlier.Two months earlier.At the heart of all of this is the P valueno hypothesis ritual.At the heart of this is the illusionthat academics create knowledgeby using this null hypothesis P value ritual.I can't wait to have Gert on our program,it's gonna be mind blowing.To detect the difference between the data and the null.And that means more easily reject the nulland you can claim victory for your hypothesis.- Let's hear that again.- And you can imagine that's another factorthat leads to the irreplicability of results.The only good statistic is Bayesian statisticsand that Bayesian methods are even more automaticin his opinion than Fisher's randomness.So the danger is here,you don't have much progress if you use based factorsjust as mindless.So let me go on.The examples about mindless use sound funny,but there are deep costs of the ritual.I give you a few example.Maybe the first and quite interesting one isthat you actually fear betterif you don't specify your own hypothesis.Why?- Paul Meal once pointed out a methodologically paradox.- I mean, think about this.- Improvement of experimental measurementand amount of data is--- Make it harder for the theory to--- What is Robert Malone testing in his thingif there is no SARS-CoV-2?What is he testing in that?Think about how malevolent it is.Think about how malevolent it is, please.- Once pointed out a methodologically paradox in physics,improvement of experimental measurementand amount of data make it harder for the theory to passbecause you can more easily distinguishbetween the prediction of the theory and the actual data.In fields--- This is the problem with virology, of course,that as the resolution of our genetic sequencing capabilities,our genetic manufacturing capabilities,our ability to see and isolate single sequenceswho have like nanopore sequencing and this kind of thingshould make it easier for us to raise the levelof understanding we have in virology.But these people are stuck with methodsthat are still from the '40s and they're fine with it.Plack assays and cytopathic effect assays,which the no-virus people are very right to lambast them about.Never mind that they generate P valuesfrom those really dumb methodologiesthat have never been challengedbecause their hypothesis that they're testingis not the hypothesis of how viruses work.Their hypothesis is the null hypothesisthat they're testing,that whatever they're doing in their experimentsisn't causing anything.Which is something they don't believe in.So they're not testing their hypothesis,they're testing a hypothesis they don't believe inand then when they get results,they say that that result proves the thing they never tested.- On the null ritual, it's the opposite.So because it tests a null in which you don't believe.If there's no COVID then actually,silicoxib and famotidine and ivermectin,there's no way to test their effectiveness on it.You see that, right?And so that's why the illusion of a novel virusthat needs novel treatments that's killing millions of peoplethat millions more could be saved fromthat likely came from a laboratory leakand likely could come again.That's why that faith is so dangerousand why it's so obviously malevolentthat Malone is not questioning any of that faith,instead fully reinforcing it with an absolute malevolent fraudlike Paul Cottrell.- So improvements of measurement make it more easierto detect the difference between the data and the null.And that means more easily reject the nulland you can claim victory for your hypothesis.And you can just imagine.That's another factor that leadsto the irreplicability of results.Second point, and I'll now get to the delusions.And about the sacred object, the p-value.Now a p-value is the probability of a resultor a more extreme one if the null hypothesis is correct.And more technically correct,it is the probability of a test statisticalgiven an entire model.And but the point is it's a probability of datagiven hypothesis, not the patient probability.And that should be easy to understandfor any academic researcher.- Except they don't teach it.- And also it's not the probabilitythat you will be able to replicate it.And the replication--- You would actually be surprisedhow many academicians actually can't enunciate that though.That p-value is not the odds by which you can replicate it.It's not the odds that you will see it again.It's nothing like that.And a lot of people, including graduate studentsin the biomedical sciences would explain it that wayin a heartbeat because they've learnedfrom these shitty statistics booksthat kind of tell it that way.You see the problem?- Delusion, that's the first one,is that when you have a p-value of 1%,then logically it follows that the probabilitythat you can replicate your result is 99%.So this illusion has been already told in the bookthat Greg pointed out by Nanaly.It's a great reading.If you have fun, you won't really have fun.Read the old textbooks about statistics.They're all not written by statisticians,otherwise they wouldn't have been used.(laughing)So, and for instance, Nanaly writes--- That's fantastic.- What does a p-value of 5% mean?His answer, the investigator can be confidentwith odds of 95 out of 100that the observed difference will hold upin further investigation.- Wrong.Wow, that is so wrong and it's wonderful.They've written this into books.- What is the state today?- Do academic researchers understandwhat a p-value means?So the object they are looking for.So I serve with all studies available--- Here you go.- In six different countries,with a total of over 800 academic psychologistsand about 1,000 students,and they will all ask,what does a p-value of 1% mean?- Oh boy, here we go. - How many of these--- Oh my gosh, it's gonna break your heart.- Cherries, the replica village.- Oh my back.- So in this sample, there were 115 personswho taught statistics.But you should know that in the social sciences,mostly and certainly not in psychology,those who teach statistics are not statisticians,for the same reason,because they would notice what's going on.What do you think?What proportion of 115 statistics teachersthat's across six countries fall preyto the illusion of repubility?It should be zero, it is 20%.- Damn.- Then we have looked at the professors,and that's over 700 in this study.In the professors, it's 39%.- Hey, there you go.So the students actually know it better than the professors.Do you see?The professors must understand it in the incorrect wayin order to use it correctly.That's why I failed.And I'm not saying it in a bad way,I'm just saying that I couldn't get it.I didn't get it.I didn't understand it.And if Gert would have been my friendwhen I was in academic biology,I might have left earlier,or I might have tried harder to do it correctlyand then found a niche or found a right mentoror made the right choices,but for whatever reason, right up until the very end,I was still just playing this gameof trying to make measurementsand seeing if there's significantand then trying to explain that significancein some biologically significant way.Playing this game,and once you see it, it's like, wow, really?'Cause I learned a lot.I had a lot of fun.I read a lot of papersand I thought about a lot of interesting things,but I've also watched a lot of peoplecreate a lot of noiseand somewhat participated in it on the sideline.Maybe I didn't create as much noiseas other people were creating,but I was caught up in the ideaof trying to understand how all this noise,which at the time I thought was knowledge,needed to be incorporatedinto my understanding of the brain.And of course, when you're incorporating garbage,you get garbage out.And so that's where the damage is done, right?If you got all these neuroscientistsjuggling around the idea of how to find p-valuesfor genes that are associated with autismand trying to create significant animal models of autismthat are only measured in their significanceby this mindless ritual,then you can understand how billions of dollarscould be wasted on animal modelsthat don't recapitulate the diseaseand in experimental modelsthat don't recapitulate the situationor actually test the hypothesis,but just conveniently produce p-values of significancethat can be distorted as testing a real hypothesisinstead of disproving a nullthat the review or the designer of the experimentnever believed in in the first place.Like silicoxib and famotidine have no effect on COVID,which would be the null hypothesisthat Robert Malone tested.- Capillity in motion, so almost double.And among the poor students is 66%.They have inherited the delusion.And note that this is another reasonwhy the replicability crisisis not being noticed until recentlybecause of this illusion.I have a problem, it is a p-value of 1%,I can be almost sure, can be replicated.Now, it's not the only delusionthat is shared by the academic researchers.So the next delusion is that you thinkthat p-value is a probability of data given hypothesistells you about the probability of the hypothesisgiven to data.And the majority of academic psychologistsin six countries and in every studyshares at least one and typically severalof these illusions, including that the p-value of 1%tells you that the probability of the null hypothesisthrough is auto 1% or that the alternative hypothesisis through is 99% and so it goes on.This is a remarkable state of the art of doing science.Remarkable because everyone of these academicresearchers understands the probability of A given Bis not the probability given A,but with individual thinking is blocked.- Yes, say it Gert.- So another blind spot, the cost is obviously effect size.There's no effect size in the original.There's an effect of the name in a person.Yeah, but that's not being told.- So does everybody understand that?If you're a statistic student at all,you would have heard of effect sizeand that has to do with, okay,how many numbers are you testing?If it's only a difference between five peopleand five people, the power and the effect sizemight be smaller than if it's a thousand peopleand a thousand people and the difference between themis X or Y and so there are these all kindsof other statistical numbers that could be includedin the ritual that would in theory give the ritualmore resolution to distinguish between the resultand randomness, but instead the ritual containsnone of these things that should have been incorporatedfrom the original theories, but instead leaves them outalmost seemingly on purpose.- Ski and Siliak asked the question,do economists distinguish between significance?- And now think about the fact that economyand economics models and finance and financial modelshave been made to create the illusion of knowledgeusing the same fricking ritual.That actually Paul Cottrell got a PhD in financeusing the same p-value ritualand probably didn't even test a hypothesisabout chaos or anything like that.- So statistical significance and economic significance.And they looked at the papers in one of the top journals,the American Economic Review, and of 182 papers,70% did not make a distinction.And what Siliak and McCloskey did,they published the names of those who got most confused,including a number of Nobel laureates.- Hoops.- 10 years later, they repeated that,assuming that everyone must have read thatand people are now more reasonable,but the 70% who confused it,the number didn't go down, it went up to 82.Similar, there's a blind spot for statistical power.There is no power in the Nobel Prize ritual.And power means the probabilitythat you find an effect if there is one.And that should be 80%, 90%, better, higher.The psychologists--- Do you understand that there is a sort of minimumthreshold of samples that you can takein order to have a pretty good chanceof seeing a difference?And if there is very little difference between the groups,then you're gonna need a lot more numbersin order to see it reliablythan if, for example, there's a giant difference.Like the difference between my heightand the height of all other little kids under the age of four,you wouldn't need very many kids under the age of fourto get a statistical result.And the likelihood that you would find a resultis very high because the difference is very bigbetween me and all kids.But if it was between me and other high school basketballplayers, then although our ages are different,our height might be tend to be very much similar.So in order to see whether there's any differencebetween me and them, you might need a lot more of them.And that's a very bad example, 'cause I'm a group of one.But he is trying to teach,or trying to cite a very broad idea in statisticsand showed to you that the resolutionof a statistical result in the null ritualis absolutely positively not the goal.If the goal was to accurately describethe statistical result, then you would use powerand you would use effect size to describe the p-valuewith some parameters.But they're not part of the null hypothesis,despite the fact that they were part of the statisticaltheories from which the null hypothesispurported to be drawn, or the testing of the null hypothesisis purported to be drawn.And it is this illusion, this fake mechanismof knowledge creation that has been used malevolentlyagainst us to create the illusion of RNA viruses,the need for public healthand the effectiveness of the vaccine schedule.These are all very, very central,and they are very, very much created, protected by,and edified by this null ritualthat Gert has now so eloquently shown usis running rampant across all academic fields,including economy, economics, psychology,and biomedical sciences, including fricking drugs,like Robert Malone just added,it just wonderfully explained to Paul Kattrell.- When it was the first one,who systematically studied the powerof a major clinical channel,and he found that the average power for a medium effectwas 46%.That wasn't much.Now, Peter Siedelmeyer and I, 25 years later,which should be a time that things change.That airplane is in Arizona,sorry, I can't get rid of that sound.- Look, I analyzed the power in the same channel.Before it was 46, it went down to 37.Why?Because many researchers now did alpha adjustment,which decreases the power.And notice what that means.If you set up an experiment,that has only a power of, say, 30%,to detect an effect if there's one.You could do better and much more cheaperby throwing a coin,and you would have a power of 50%, clear?- How extraordinary is that?How extraordinary is that the null hypothesisdoes not involve even finding out whetherthe number of measurements you've madehas any real statistical power to find a resultif there is one.They don't even have to tell you that.- You could spare all this effort.And what I've told you now, or even the better results,studies in neuroscience,so for instance, studies about Alzheimer's disease,genetics, cancer biomarkers,the median power of more than 700 studies is 21%.- Cancer biomarkers, genetics.You mean like the genetic causes of autism?You see where I'm going with this, ladies and gentlemen.You see where the broken science initiativeis going with this,why the broken science initiative is so important,that Malcolm Kendrick, the placebo master,and the statin's guy is in the same room as Gert Gigerenser,is in the same room as the guy who runs Giga-Ohm Biological,is in the same room as the guy who invented CrossFit,is in the same room as Matt Briggs,is in the same room,bringing these people togetherand trying to find an organized wayto start to spread this knowledge,spread these ideas,and to slowly dismantle the mythologythat has been created using these ideasis of utmost importance to our children.I want to watch the rest of this,but I don't have timeand my back is absolutely murdering me right now,and I'm gonna pull the triggerand say, I'll pull the riff chord right now,and I apologize for that.I will watch the rest of this.Maybe we'll watch the rest of it tomorrow.I do think that I put extra stuff in herewith the Paul Cottrell video,and so it makes it a little harder to,but just don't forget,this is our hypothesis, ladies and gentlemen,it's not gonna change.And this was Gert Gigerenser.Mindless statistics, the broken science initiative,you can find this full video on YouTube,you can also find iton the broken science initiative website.It would be great if you guys would goto the broken science initiative websiteand make a member,just join and make a username,so that Emily can see that I'm pushing people thereand drawing attention to their work.There's lots of other videos there,including videos by Malcolm Kendrick,who's one of the more entertaining peopleto talk about this kind of stuff,and Malcolm is also gonna be on our showin the next couple of weeks, I think.So just looking forward, seeing the progress,I hope you can see it too.Broken science initiative is really the waythat Gig-Om Biological is gonna get off of this COVIDdissident narrative,breaking and move on to bigger and better thingsduring the week,and then maybe only once a week,we have to revisit some of these posersand the mythologies that they are still perpetuatingon social media.Remember, don't take their bait on TV.Remember, stay focused on the biology,and remember that you gotta love your neighbors.I love you all very much, ladies and gentlemen.See you again soon.Thomas Kuhn and Farabend are also guys that are featured,actually in one of my favorite booksthat I'm reading for the second time already,and that's this one, "Paper and After,"written by David Stove.So this is a book, actually,that the Broken Science Initiative now owns the rights to,and so I think on the Broken Science Initiative website,you can actually get a PDF of this book.It's really thin and it's really easy,and it's the only basis for which I understandany of this stuff that Gert and other people are talking about.I'm now breaking into trying to read Matt Briggs's book,"I'm About Randomness,"but this is the one that's helped me get to the stagewhere I can at least have a conversationwith some of these people and know what they're talking about,and so don't ever think that I'm an expert.We're just doing it together at best.I'm a tutor and a biologist.It's read a few more hours than you haveon some of these topics, and that's it.Otherwise, I'm just an imperfect husbandand an imperfect papa, and I love you all very much,and thanks very much for your support.I'll see you again soon.(silence)(silence)(silence)[BLANK_AUDIO]
